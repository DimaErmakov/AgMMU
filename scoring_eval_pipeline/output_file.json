Keep in mind that at this time of the year (June 2022), the intensity of the sun is at its maximum. For my own beans, this is the time of the year I cover them with a fabric row cover for protection. Having said that, there is not much you can do at this time regarding these brown leaves. Most likely they will not recover. Attempting to reseed things now would be an exercise in futility. Just keep them well watered \u2013 like daily \u2013 and do not apply any fertilizer. That would only stress them further. It is not clear to me if flowers have already emerged and some beans established on your beans. Maybe not?\u00a0In any event your plants, provided you water them sufficiently, will survive although perhaps with a diminished yield. For your 2023 beans consider some type of row cover for them.</p> <p>Good Luck</p>",

If the camera has trouble focusing on the objects because of their size or due to background objects, you can try to either hold a piece of white paper behind them or a ruler next to them (the fine markings on the ruler should help the camera focus at the right distance).<br /> <br /> Miri",

Normally aphids give birth to live young, but they can lay eggs (especially for overwintering), plus this type of aphid is so large that their eggs will also be pretty big by aphid standards. We can't predict if they'll stay warm enough for long enough to hatch indoors, but you can pluck them off if you prefer. They won't cause any plant damage and will merely be a nuisance to remove with a vacuum\u00a0if they do hatch before the tree is removed after the holiday.<br /> <br /> Miri",

                "answer": "The image shows a close-up of pine needles, which appear to be fresh and healthy, indicating that the tree was recently cut and is being used as a Christmas tree indoors. However, the focus on the needles suggests attention should be given to the overall condition of the tree.\n\nFor a Christmas tree that has been cut and brought indoors, here are some general recommendations to manage and maintain its freshness:\n\n1. **Watering**: Ensure the tree is kept hydrated by regularly watering it with a bucket of water placed at the base of the tree. The water should be changed daily to prevent it from becoming stagnant and potentially harboring bacteria or mold.\n\n2. **Pruning**: If there are any dead or dry needles, they should be pruned off to maintain the tree's health and appearance. This will also help keep the tree from shedding needles indoors.\n\n3. **Humidity**: Place the tree in a humid environment if possible, such as near a radiator or in a room with a humidifier. This can help prevent the needles from drying out too quickly.\n\n4. **Placement**: Avoid placing the tree near heat sources like fireplaces or radiators, as these can cause the needles to dry out faster. It\u2019s also important to keep it away from direct sunlight, which can damage the needles.\n\n5. **Cleaning**: Dust the tree gently with a soft cloth or use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any dust or debris that might have accumulated during transportation or storage.\n\n6. **Lighting**: If the tree is decorated with lights, ensure that the lights are not overexposed to the needles, as this can cause them to dry out or become damaged.\n\n7. **Regular Inspection**: Regularly check the tree for any signs of pests or disease. If you notice any issues, consult a professional horticulturist or arborist for advice.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure that your Christmas tree remains fresh and vibrant throughout the holiday season.",

When necessary, a number of pesticides are effective in controlling viburnum leaf beetles. Products containing carbaryl (Sevin) as the active ingredient or one of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, permethrin, resmethrin) are highly effective as foliar sprays. Honey bees and other pollinators can be protected by waiting until the petals fall before spraying, or by removing the flowers before spraying. Soil-applied systemic products that contain imidacloprid are also effective, but should also be applied after the flowers are gone to protect bees.</p>\n<p>Also, we have a research project underway to see if a basal soil drench of imidacloprid applied after the flowers are gone will harm bees in the following year.

They are not found in Maryland and, so far at least, are only established in\u00a0parts of\u00a0the very southernmost U.S.\u00a0The insect in the photo is a commonly-encountered local wasp called a European Hornet. While they are indeed\u00a0not native to North America, they have been here for a long time - around two hundred years. Like other wasps, their prey is other insects.\u00a0Here are some additional images for comparison:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.marylandbiodiversity.com/view/6472\">https://www.marylandbiodiversity.com/view/6472</a></p><p>Adult hornets can accidentally wander inside since they fly day and night; at night, they can be drawn to outdoor lighting (as with many night-flying insects), become disoriented, and settle-down nearby, which usually involves a window or doorway. When the door is\u00a0opened or if a gap in the wall or window frame\u00a0is available as they explore, they can easily wind-up indoors, even though they are not deliberately trying to invade the home. It is rare, but not unheard of, for them to build a nest inside a building (an exterior wall or attic would be most likely). If you have found only one or two, then it's likely an accident. If you regularly find more, consider contacting a pest control professional who has experience in wasp removal to find and destroy the nest safely.</p><p>Try turning off outdoor lights at night, or make sure there aren't gaps, holes, or cracks in wall exteriors that could be allowing them inside. Similarly, make sure window insect screens are intact and not torn, where an exploring wasp can get through.</p><p>Despite their alarming size, they tend to only sting to defend themselves (if attacked) or their nest.

After looking at your photos, though, I'm very happy to say that the browning looks pretty much like normal seasonal needle drop (called flagging). It appears to be the older, interior fronds that are dying. All evergreens have to drop older leaves/needles at some point, it's just a question of how many years they keep them before dropping them.<br /> Now there may still be some problem with the trees. It does look like quite a lot of the interior is turning brown. There could have been drought stress causing them to lose more needles than normal, or some other stress. I suggest keeping an eye on them and see how they do next spring and through next season. You might consider supplemental irrigation next summer. If they get thinner each year they are not well, but if they put on plenty of healthy new growth and just lose the oldest, they are fine.<br /> <a href=\"https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/cedar-cedrus-spp-cedar-flagging\">https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/cedar-cedrus-spp-cedar-flagging</a>",

It's difficult to make specific recommendations without more information (space available, desired mature size, whether deer browsing is an issue, desirable features like flowering or evergreen, etc.), but given the shady exposure, here is a starter list of ideas:<ul><li><strong>Leucothoe</strong> (Leucothoe fontanesiana, Leucothoe axillaris) - native near our region, though not in Maryland specifically; evergreen; deer-resistant</li><li><strong>American Holly</strong> (Ilex opaca), specifically variety '<strong>Maryland Dwarf</strong>' because no other variety is small enough - easy to trim but shouldn't need it often due to slow growth rate and compact size; evergreen; deer-resistant; although it could produce a few decorative berries, this variety doesn't fruit heavily</li><li>other <strong>Hollies</strong> (Ilex, multiple species and hybrids) - although they only other shrubby evergreen holly is more sun-loving (Inkberry), several options exist among the Chinese, Japanese, Blue, and other hybrid varieties; if dry soil is a concern, Chinese hollies have the best tolerance within this group; all are evergreen; deer only tend to avoid the very prickly varieties; not all varieties will produce berries</li><li><strong>Illicium</strong> (Illicium, several species and hybrids) - look for those rated cold-hardy to zone 6 ideally, but those hardy to zone 7 should suffice if this site is sheltered from winter winds; evergreen; deer-resistant; some species are native, though not in MD</li><li><strong>False Holly</strong> (Osmanthus heterophyllus) - prickly holly look-alike with fragrant autumn flowers; evergreen; deer-resistant</li><li><strong>Yew</strong> (Taxus) or <strong>Japanese Plum Yew</strong> (Cephalotaxus) - one of the only needled evergreens to tolerate shade; the former deer will eat, but the latter they dislike; several cultivars exist for each with different growth habits and mature sizes, though Yew is pretty easy to trim if needed</li><li><strong>Summersweet</strong> (Clethra alnifolia) - blooms best with more sun, but should tolerate shade if not too dark; fragrant summer blooms; deciduous; somewhat deer-resistant; dwarf varieties exist if the wild type is too tall<strong><br /> </strong></li><li><strong>Spicebush</strong> (Lindera benzoin) - fragrant foliage when bruised; deciduous; native; better for large spaces as it can't be kept too small via pruning</li><li><strong>Fothergilla</strong> (Fothergilla major, Fothergilla gardenii, and their hybrids) - native to the southeast but hardy here; deciduous; blooms best with partial sun but tolerant of shade; somewhat deer-resistant; not easily trimmed but compact varieties exist</li><li><strong>Carolina Allspice</strong> (Calycanthus floridus) - native to the southeast but hardy here; as the above, blooms best with a bit of sun but tolerates shade; very fragrant flowers;\u00a0somewhat deer-resistant; not easily trimmed for size, so best where it will fit with minimal pruning</li></ul> We suggest that, if space allows, you mix species so the planting isn't as vulnerable to a single ailment affecting the entire garden bed equally severely. Diverse plantings (especially using flowering shrubs or perennials)\u00a0also tend to provide habitat for a wider array of beneficial insects, which help to suppress pests before they reach outbreak level.<br /> <br /> Miri",

                "answer": "The image shows a plant that appears to be wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis), which is a common weed known for its ability to rapidly spread in agricultural areas, fields, and barnyards. Based on the provided background information and the characteristics of the plant in the image, here is a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Regular Manual Removal**: Since the affected area is not too large, continued manual removal remains an effective method. The fact that the roots are tough and wiry indicates that it's important to pull the plants completely, including the roots, to prevent regrowth.\n\n2. **Early Detection and Removal**: The mention that the weed has been pulled every morning suggests a proactive approach. This practice should continue, as early detection and removal help prevent the plant from setting seed and spreading.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Implementing cultural practices such as maintaining healthy and competitive crop cover can help reduce the establishment of weeds like wild mustard. This includes regular crop rotation, maintaining soil fertility, and ensuring adequate moisture levels.\n\n4. **Mulching**: Applying mulch around crops can help suppress weed growth. This practice is especially effective when combined with careful cultivation practices to minimize weed seed dispersal.\n\n5. **Chemical Control**: If manual removal becomes impractical or if the infestation grows larger, chemical herbicides may be considered. However, care must be taken to choose products that are effective against wild mustard and safe for the environment and other crops. Always follow the label instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n6. **Biological Control**: Investigate whether there are any biological control options available for wild mustard, such as specific insects or fungi that target the plant without harming other organisms.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage wild mustard in your field or barnyard. Regular monitoring and timely intervention will be key to maintaining control over this persistent weed.",

The leaf picture is not clear.  Hornbeam leaves are thick and raised between veins giving it a corrugated feel.  It does have the vertically striated bark that becomes more clearly sinewy as the tree ages. It has beech like leaves.  And it thrives on rocky soil.  To learn more see the following websites.  If you do not believe this is the right tree, send us more pictures-one of the entire tree (tree shapes are good for identification) and one branch, so we can see the leaf attachments and structures. Also describe the leaves..hairy? Or smooth? Both sides of leaves are they the same color or different?\n1. https://www.chicagobotanic.org/plantinfo/tree_alternatives/american_hornbeam\n2. https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=h540",

The water is not reaching the edges of the leaves and they are dying. Whether this is from our heat waves or the lawn competing with the roots of the grass for water or both, the top newest leaves look OK so I would wait and see what happens next spring. <br /> <br /> Don't take off any of the leaves that still have green on them, as they are still sending sugars to the roots even with the outside brown. And it might help to clear some of the lawn away from the tree so the water can get directly to the roots.<br /> <br /> Good luck and cross your fingers the tree will be fine once it gets a chance to get established.",

There were a lot of leaves and small apples on the ground. Two days ago we noticed that the leaves on the tree are starting to curl. \n\nWanting to know if this is due to the hail damage or some type of bug/fungus that the tree needs to be sprayed for. \n\nAny advice is most appreciated!\nThank you,\nKari",

This type of hail causes damage of all kinds to fruit trees, especially apples and crabapples.</p>\n\n<p>If the leaf curling is all over the tree, or at least limited to the side the hail hit hardest, then the leaf curling is a typical response to injury, along with the prolonged heat. From what I can see in the pictures, in general your tree is in fair shape; much of the canopy remains (so photosynthesis still occurs) and you will still have some apples (though a bit scarred).</p>\n\n<p>If the leaf curling is just on the tips of branches, and the tips wilt and die back, suspect fireblight.

Your delicious trees are resistant to this disease, but this has been a bad year for fireblight. These leaves cannot be composted, and the apples will not be edible.

Looking at the\nphoto, it may also perhaps be the cold snap with snow &amp; ice that froze the\nneedles on those branches. It looks like the problem area is adjacent to a\nfence so shady areas tend to be even much colder and ice is longer-lasting. You\ndidn't mention if the entire middle section on all sides is affected, or only\none area of the center. Also, since there is no photo of the buds at the top,\nwe can assume that these are healthy buds? That's a good sign. The tree isn't\nnecessarily dying. But the needles that turned brown will not turn green or\nre-grow. </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Evergreens lose moisture all year long from their needles,\nso keeping the tree well-watered helps keep the tree healthy. Also, if you have\nnot done so, adding organic mulch around the base of the tree helps retain\nmoisture in the soil. </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Improper planting (too deep, too shallow, hole not large\nenough, etc.) can all contribute to the browning of needles, but it is\ndifficult to know if this is the reason or not. Again, keep the tree watered during\nthe dry periods of winter. Norway spruce is susceptible to drought, even when\nmature, so watering it year-round is something you will need to do in times of\ndrought and extreme heat. Watch for new growth on the tips in spring (see\nattached photo).</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>See CSU Fact Sheet on winter watering:</p>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/fall-and-winter-watering-7-211/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/fall-and-winter-watering-7-211/</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

These are common garden pests in our area, with mint being one of their preferred host plants. The good news is that they only have one new generation each year, and\u00a0will be gone from your garden around the end of June. At that point, you can remove the damaged portions of your plant, and it should recover. As you probably already know, mint can be cut back almost entirely at that point in the summer, and given adequate moisture, will flush out with fresh new growth. So if a large portion of your plants is affected, you can cut the plants back hard and let them regrow.<br /> <br /> We don't really recommend using contact pesticides, such as horticultural oil or soap, to control four-lined plant bugs because they move extremely quickly and are therefore quite difficult to spray.

                "answer": "The plant in the image appears to be a species of ragweed, which is known for its prolific seed production and allergenic pollen. The presence of ragweed in a pollinator garden can be problematic because it tends to outcompete native plants and produce an abundance of pollen that can be harmful to some pollinators.\n\nGiven that this is the second year of a pollinator garden, the recommended management strategy for the issue seen in the image would likely include the following steps:\n\n1. **Hand-Picking Seeds**: Regularly remove the seeds from the ragweed plants as they mature. This can help prevent the spread of the plant and reduce the pollen load in the garden.\n\n2. **Mechanical Removal**: Use hand tools or a weed whacker to remove the ragweed plants from the garden. This should be done before they flower and set seed to minimize their impact on the local ecosystem.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**: If mechanical removal is not feasible, chemical herbicides that target broadleaf weeds (such as dicamba or 2,4-D) can be used to control the ragweed. However, it's important to use these chemicals carefully to avoid harming beneficial insects and other plants in the garden.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**: Enhance the overall health and competitiveness of the native plants by ensuring they have adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight. A diverse mix of native plants can help outcompete and suppress the growth of invasive species like ragweed.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Prevention**: Continue to monitor the garden for new invasions of ragweed or other invasive species. Early intervention is crucial to prevent the establishment of invasive plants in your pollinator garden.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help maintain a healthy and diverse pollinator garden while minimizing the negative impacts of invasive species such as ragweed.",

It can be so bad that our patio and chairs have a sap like residue to them. It draws bees and it get all over our herb garden and it is messy. \r\n\r\nA local arborist encouraged a pressure washer treatment with dish soap directly to the leaves, which worked well last year. This year, it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. We are also noticing some of the leaves are dying and falling. I included a photo of the dying leaves on top of a honeydew covered chair. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations would be so appreciated. \r\n\r\nShould we just keep power washing the leaves with soap or is there anything else we can do? \r\n\r\nAlso, what ratio of soap to water would you recommend if that is the best course of action?\r\n\r\nThank you so much.

It can be difficult to maintain the health of aspen trees in Oregon home landscapes due to soil issues and limited growing space. Aspen naturally want to spread via root suckers, so keeping them healthy while limiting them to a small area can be a challenge. Drought, heat, insects, and disease, often in combination, are common damage agents for aspen, especially at lower elevations in the Willamette Valley area (aspen are more of a mountain tree). Keeping the trees well watered and also in full sun is recommended.<br /> <br /> All that said, for more specific advice, it may be best to look for an arborist who is familiar with aspen and treatments to maintain them in a home landscape. From what I have read, treatments to improve soil health and other systemic treatments to control insects and mites can be helpful. If you are not using insecticides, the periodic washing with soapy water is your best option. <br /> <br /> As a forester, I am most familiar with native forest trees in forest settings and I am less knowledgeable on urban landscape tree issues.",

                "answer": "The image shows a young aspen tree with leaves that appear to be yellowing and some brown spots, which could indicate stress or damage. Given the context provided, the trees were recently planted, experienced a hailstorm, and were fertilized with a seaweed-based organic foliar fertilizer. Here's a recommended management strategy for the issues observed:\n\n1. **Assess Damage**: Confirm the extent of the damage caused by the hailstorm. Check if there are any significant structural damage or loss of major branches.\n\n2. **Monitor Growth**: Keep an eye on the growth rate of the trees. Young aspen trees can recover from minor stress but may require more attention if the damage is severe.\n\n3. **Fertilization Review**: Since the trees were fertilized with a seaweed-based organic foliar fertilizer, review the application method and timing. Excessive fertilization, especially with nitrogen-rich compounds, can lead to leaf burn or other stress symptoms. Ensure that future applications are appropriately balanced and not excessive.\n\n4. **Watering**: Ensure that the trees receive adequate moisture, particularly during the first few years after planting. Hailstorms can impact the amount of water reaching the roots due to soil compaction or debris. Monitor the watering schedule to ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.\n\n5. **Pruning**: If there is significant damage to branches, prune them back to healthy growth points. This will help direct the tree\u2019s energy towards new growth rather than trying to heal damaged areas.\n\n6. **Disease Management**: Inspect the leaves for signs of disease. Yellowing leaves could also be a symptom of nutrient deficiencies, pest infestations, or disease. If necessary, consult a horticulturist for appropriate treatments.\n\n7. **Protective Measures**: Consider protective measures like using netting or protective covers to shield the trees from further hail damage. This is especially important for newly planted trees that may still be developing their root systems and structural integrity.\n\n8. **Support Structures**: If the trees appear to have leaning or weak trunks, consider supporting them with stakes or guy wires to prevent windthrow, which can exacerbate damage.\n\n9. **Soil Health**: Ensure the soil around the trees is rich in organic matter and nutrients. This will support healthy root growth and overall plant health. Regularly test the soil pH and nutrient levels to adjust accordingly.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help the aspen trees recover from the recent hail damage and ensure they grow strong and healthy.",

Little tiny ones like to hide in the newer leaves so I've learned to look there too. Could you help me identify the culprit(s) and suggest some treatment options? Because I'm trying to get these plants established, I'm pinching off flowers and trying to prevent fruit from forming, but the destruction of leaves is not helping here.

You can prune out the dead/dying branches and many times boxwood will rebound from this. The bottom of the link has a boxwood pruning video for guidance. They will look sparse for a few years until they grow back in so if that is not a look you are ok with since it looks like the front of your home, then you may want to consider replacing them. While no plant is disease proof there are new cultivars of boxwood that have better disease resistance than others. Look for varieties such as 'New Gen' 'Green Velvet' 'Green Mountain' or any that state they have better disease resistance.</p> <p>Emily</p>",

Most pictures used for identification of spiders are of adults, which usually have distinct characteristics. Baby spiderlings of many different species can look very similar, and there are very few photos of these stages for any spiders. Be that as it may, your photos give me some clues as to what this might be. The location and overall shape of the spider suggests this is a type of cobweb spider in the family Theridiidae. The photo of the underside shows a large reddish, vaguely hourglass shape which made me suspicious that this might be a \"widow\" spider in the genus Latrodectus. The brownish color, and the series of black \"eyespots\" on the top of the abdomen appear similar to what you might find on an adult brown widow, Latrodectus geometricus. There are lots of pictures of adult brown widows on the web but I only found one picture of brown widow spiderlings and it does seem similar to your \"spotted\" photo. Again, I can't absolutely be certain these are brown widow spiderlings or not, but that is my best guess at this point. Brown widows are known to be in California. Fortunately, unlike the black widow spider, rare bites from brown widow spiders are usually not considered to be medically significant. However, it might still be a good idea to remove these spiders or treat the area with a household insecticide. I have included some links below to websites with more information about this species. </p><p><a href=\"http://bugguide.net/node/view/23403\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bugguide.net/node/view/23403</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrodectus_geometricus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrodectus_geometricus</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.spiders.us/species/filter/california/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.spiders.us/species/filter/california/</a></p><p></p>",

If you aren't able to find the source in stored food products, it is possible that they are attracted to a dead animal (e.g., mouse in the basement or attic). Check the basement or crawl space. Vacuum up the moths that you see and double-check stored food items.

It is hard to really determine which member of the\nDayflower Family this is. From a vegetative standpoint, the leaf sheaths split\nwith white hair up and down the split area. Secondly, enlargement of some of\nthe leaves shows a more cordate and clasping leaf and the stem nodes are hairy\nwith white hairs. It is similar to many of the genus Commelina,\ndayflowers, but it apparently does not have any petioled lower leaves. From\nthis examination of vegetative characteristics, to the best of my knowledge and\nability, the plant is Tinantia anomala (Torr.) C. Clarke in the\nCommelinaceae or Dayflower Family. As a semi-succulent type plant, it is a\nnative, cool season annual that is commonly named \u201cfalse dayflower\u201d and\n\u201cwidow\u2019s tear\u201d. It is reported to occur on the Coastal Prairie and Marshes,\nBlackland Prairie, Cross Timbers and Prairies and Edwards Plateau. It grows\nupright and prostrate on the ground and is noted to make a good ground cover\nthat will be green in the winter months. This species was first reported as a\nhybrid between Commelina and Tradescantia (spiderworts) but is\nnow a member of a genus with 20 species worldwide. This species usually flowers\nin April through July. In a lawn situation, because of mowing, we are only\nseeing vegetative growth and a much branched stem growth on the ground. Because\nof mowing, we are not seeing the more upright growth of the plant when present.\nThe flowers should have two showy lavender to bluish petals. Please do a google\nsearch on this scientific name and see what you think before replying on the\neXtension system. I hope this information will be helpful in your reply to the\nHouston client.

        "question": "I planted my Red Twig, purchased from a reputable nursery, in March 2021, with some all around fertilizer mixed into the dirt/landscaping mix at the bottom of the planting hole. When I took it out of the pot, all the pot dirt fell off; it was planted as bare root, for all practical purposes. I located it in my sunny, rain garden location. It thrived. Although we have had a dry spring in Portland, I have watered well and it has continued to thrive, or so I have thought. However, for the last couple of weeks, the leaves are turning from green to lighter and lighter yellow-green, until now the impression as I look at the tree is that it has yellow leaves. Also, what I took to be buds forming now look all dried up. Is something wrong with my tree?\r\nThank you for your help.\r\nCheri",

Mostly, I'm wondering what the critter is. But, a lot of geraniums flowers seem to have died without blooming recently. I thought that could be related to how wet the weather has been (lots of brown, moldy leaves on the plants also). But, could these fellows be killing off the buds?",

This symptom can sometimes be indicative of various issues such as overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiencies, pests, or environmental stressors like extreme temperatures.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Ensure the soil around the hosta is well-drained. Overwatering can cause roots to rot, leading to puckering of leaves. Adjust watering frequency based on the moisture level of the soil; ensure the top inch of soil is dry before watering again.\n\n2. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: A lack of certain nutrients can lead to leaf distortion. Check if the hosta is getting adequate amounts of nitrogen, magnesium, and iron. Fertilize according to the specific needs of your hosta species.\n\n3. **Pests**: While puckering could be due to pests, inspect the underside of the leaves closely for signs of infestation (e.g., small insects, webs). If you suspect pests, consider using an appropriate insecticide or organic control method.\n\n4. **Environmental Stress**: High heat or direct sunlight can cause leaf puckering. Consider providing shade to the plant if it is in full sun. Ensure the area around the hosta is shaded appropriately during hot weather.\n\n5. **Recovery Time**: If the puckering is mild and not accompanied by other symptoms like discoloration or wilting, the plant may recover on its own. Keep an eye on the plant and continue monitoring for further changes.\n\n**Management Strategy**:\n- **Check Soil Moisture**: Ensure the soil is not overly wet and adjust watering as necessary.\n- **Inspect for Pests**: Look for signs of pests on the underside of leaves and treat accordingly if needed.\n- **Provide Shade**: Offer shade to protect the hosta from excessive heat and direct sunlight.\n- **Monitor for Signs of Recovery**: Keep an eye on the hosta to see if the puckering improves or worsens.\n- **Adjust Fertilization**: Provide balanced fertilization based on soil tests if nutrient deficiencies are suspected.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help manage the puckering issue and potentially prevent it from recurring.",

It thrived for the first month until white flies began to appear all over it, scattering everywhere when I watered it. This continued for another month, until all the flies suddenly dissipated and the plant began to deteriorate despite the continuation of watering and/or rain. The leaves began to droop and holes began to appear in the leaves, along with even more white dots (and the emergence of black spots).\r\nI don't know what the best course of action is, whether I can treat the plant from this condition, or whether I should start over with a new plant.

                "response": "<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/whiteflies-vegetables\">Whiteflies</a> are a relatively common pest of annuals and some perennials, and they can produce several generations per year, so perhaps the adults disappeared but the juveniles of a new generation are still on the leaf undersides. You can look (maybe with a magnifying glass) to see if any flat, oval-shaped, pale yellow insects are still present\u00a0on the leaf bottoms. Another potential culprit, possibly overlapping with the whitefly, is <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/thrips-flowers\">thrips</a>. These sap-sucking insects cause leaf damage called stippling, which looks like fine pale does or squiggles\u00a0on the leaf, and their frass (droppings) appear as dark tar-like dots on the upper or lower leaf surfaces. Thrips can either be black or pale yellow.\u00a0One other possible pest is <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/spider-mites-vegetables\">spider mites</a>, especially since they like conditions hot and dry and this year we've had less rainfall than normal.<br /> <br /> All three pests are treatable with repeat applications of low-toxicity insecticides, though mites might be suppressed suitably enough with just a blast of plain water from a garden hose. (Tip the pot on its side so you can spray the leaf undersides, as this is where most of the mites/whitefly/thrips will be.) The simpler approach might be to just cut the whole plant back drastically (to within a couple inches of the soil) and wait for some regrowth to then treat that if you see any of those pests returning. As long as its roots are in good condition, mint regrows very well from such treatment.<br /> <br /> Plants under stress are sometimes more vulnerable to pest attacks, but many factors contribute to pest outbreaks and it can be difficult to determine exactly when and why they appeared. Mint is a very aggressive grower and can take up a lot of space, and while many Mediterranean herbs do well in drier locations since they require excellent drainage, mint is a bit less picky and might be more vulnerable to drought stress. Reflected heat from the paved surfaces and walls around the pot could be adding to any general environmental stress the plant is experiencing. Soil from the ground is usually not recommended for use in a container because it potentially holds too much water and doesn't drain very well compared to potting soil. Still, just make sure the soil is getting somewhat dry to the touch at least an inch or two deep before watering thoroughly, and if a saucer is used under the pot, empty it promptly after rain or watering the plant so that excess moisture doesn't seep back into the pot and stress roots.<br /> <br /> Has the mint been fertilized in recent weeks, or since the start of the growing season?\u00a0Although herbs in the ground rarely need fertilizer, plants in pots can\u00a0run low on certain nutrients over time if they are not replenished periodically with fertilization. The mint looks a bit nutrient-deficient, even accounting for the damage caused by pests. Any general-purpose fertilizer should suffice if one is needed, though slow-release pellets/granules tend to be more convenient as they won't need re-application nearly as often as a liquid type of fertilizer. If using a liquid, wait for the presumed pest outbreak to get more under control first, either with pruning and/or spraying, before fertilizing so those nutrients don't benefit the insects/mites at the same time. If using a granular (applied dry) fertilizer instead, you won't need to wait as its nutrients won't release immediately and that will give you time to treat the plant for pests.<br /> <br /> Miri",

Based on your location, this is most likely a cross between two subspecies: the northern watersnake, N. sipedon sipedon and the midland watersnake, N. sipedon pleuralis. All members of the genus Nerodia are non-venomous.<br><br>The northern watersnake and its subspecies have a wide distribution extending from portions of Maine south to the panhandle of Florida and as far west as portions of Colorado. They can be found in just about any type of aquatic habitat, including rivers, lakes, ponds, creeks, swamps, bayous, marshes and wetlands. They are also commonly found in water features in home owners' backyards. They often bask on rocks and fallen trees in or near the water. They also climb into bushes and small trees with branches that overhang the water.<br><br>These are thick-bodied snakes. Typical adult length is slightly under 3 feet, and maximum length can reach approximately 5.5 feet.<br><br>The northern watersnake has one of the most varied diets of any of our North American species. Research has shown that their diet includes over 80 species of fish and 30 species of amphibians.<br><br>If threatened, these snakes always attempt to escape into the water. If you corner them, they will spread their jaws and flatten the front portion of their body to make themselves appear larger and will strike and bite repeatedly if you get too close. If you pick one up, they will twist their body in an attempt to escape, while biting you and expelling a strong-smelling musk from their anal glands.<br><br>Because this specie's range often coincides with that of the venomous cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), and because they have thick bodies similar to the body shape of the cottonmouth, they are often misidentified as cottonmouths, and needlessly killed.<br><br>Here's a link to the Amphibians and Reptiles of North Carolina website's page for this species:<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://herpsofnc.org/northern-watersnake/\">http://herpsofnc.org/northern-watersnake/</a><br><br>If you would like to learn more about this and other snake species in your area, here is an excellent field guide:<br><br>Gibbons, Whit.

This is most likely spider mite damage. There are natural predators who will often take care of an infestation if you are patient enough to wait until they arrive. <br /> <br /> You can also try spraying the area with insecticidal soap or a spray containing spinosad which is a natural substance that kills spider mites and other insects. Some years are more conducive to mite populations than others but the eggs overwinter in the soil, so it is worth keeping an eye on the infestation.<br /> <br /> Good luck,<br /> ",

The pests on your roses are\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/japanese-beetles-trees-shrubs-and-flowers\">Japanese beetles</a>. They are active from the end of June through mid-August and feed most heavily during the month of July. They enjoy a variety of plants, but roses are some of their favorites. They are not native, nor beneficial, bugs and will happily defoliate your roses if not controlled. That being said, roses can handle some defoliation and should flush out new growth mid to late summer.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The best method of control is to half-fill a lidded jar with water and a touch of dish soap and shake until bubbly. Go out in the early morning or evening hours when the temperatures are coolest, as that is when the beetles will be the least active. Hold the jar underneath the branch where they are poised and tap them into the jar. They will release the branch/leaf and fall into the soapy water, getting trapped in the soap and ultimately drowning in the. water. Dispose of the water after they've died, as it can become quite smelly if left unattended. By taking care of the adult beetles you're not only helping the appearance of your plants but you'll also be\u00a0limiting the number of beetles that will lay eggs in late summer, preventing turf-root eating grubs from hatching and turning into more beetles next season!<br /> <br /> Let us know if we can answer any additional questions for you, and good luck with your beetle hunting!",

They are mostly hanging out on every last leaf of each branch (farthest from the trunk). I'm not sure why. There are only leaves and some flowers. Should I be concerned? Some are around the flowers. There isn't much damage to the leaves. Several have holes and some look like they are eaten but the tree looks healthy and has grown a lot just over the spring. There are also tiny bugs too (maybe aphids, though they are black and I thought aphids were green). Will these ants or other insects cause damage in the long run? Will the flowers be ok? I saw a video of someone soaking cotton balls with sugar and borax but I don't like chemicals and wanted an organic garden. Thanks!",

I only fertilized once last year so I am wondering if it's a pH problem and iron deficiency? One plant definitely looks like it has root rot (part of the root is hallowed out) but on other dying rhodedendrons I didn't find this problem.",

                "response": "Hi Nancy and thanks for your questions and pictures of your rhododendrons. Yes, they look stressed and there are a number of issues in your pictures. The yellowing leaves look like chlorosis which occurs when your soil pH is too high. Rhododendrons prefer 4.5-6.0 pH or pretty acidic. If you want to bring a sample for <strong>free testing tomorrow we are having our Garden Discovery Day at the Milwaukie Center on Rusk road from 9:00-12:00am.</strong><br /> Just put some soil from around the base of the plant in a plastic baggie and bring it to our desk.<br /> <a href=\"https://clackamascountymastergardeners.org/garden-discovery-day/\">https://clackamascountymastergardeners.org/garden-discovery-day/</a><br /> <br /> I also see some fungal diseases which may be a sign of stress, either from lack of water last summer, too much heat or too cold this winter. I'll attach an article that explains the disease, but DON'T fertilize as they do not need or want nitrogen when they are stressed. <br /> <a href=\"https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/azalea-rhododendron-spp-powdery-mildew\">https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/azalea-rhododendron-spp-powdery-mildew</a><br /> <br /> And I think you are right about the root rot. The symptoms seem to match your pictures and the only management is to \"remove the affected plants.\"<br /> <a href=\"https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/azalea-rhododendron-spp-cylindrocladium-blight-root-rot\">https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/azalea-rhododendron-spp-cylindrocladium-blight-root-rot</a><br /> <br /> So, to sum up, remove the plants with root rot. Don't plant another rhododendron in that place. Get a soil test for the plants with yellowing leaves and keep them watered every few weeks this summer when the weather gets hot and dry.<br /> <br /> Hope this helps!<br /> <br /> ",

                "answer": "The image shows a rhododendron plant with leaves that appear to be yellowing and some brown spots, which could indicate several potential issues such as nutrient deficiency, overwatering, underwatering, or pest infestation. Given the background information provided, the fact that the Question Asker only fertilized once last year suggests that there might be a nutrient deficiency, particularly nitrogen, which is crucial for leaf health.\n\nHere's a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Diagnosis**: \n   - Determine if the yellowing and browning are due to nutrient deficiencies by checking for signs of other issues like overwatering (roots may appear waterlogged) or underwatering (leaves may be dry and crispy).\n   - Consider consulting with a local horticulturist or garden center expert who can provide more specific advice based on the exact symptoms observed.\n\n2. **Fertilization**:\n   - Since the plant was only fertilized once last year, it might benefit from a second application of a balanced fertilizer, especially one rich in nitrogen. Use a slow-release fertilizer to avoid excessive nutrient leaching, which can cause root burn.\n   - Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package carefully, as too much nitrogen can also lead to poor root development and susceptibility to pests and diseases.\n\n3. **Water Management**:\n   - Ensure the rhododendron is neither overnor under-watered. These plants prefer consistently moist soil but not soggy conditions. Check the moisture level by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch deep; if it feels dry, it\u2019s time to water.\n   - Avoid overhead watering, which can lead to disease. Instead, water at the base of the plant and allow excess water to drain away to prevent root rot.\n\n4. **Pruning**:\n   - Remove any dead or yellowing leaves and branches to promote healthy growth and reduce the risk of disease spread.\n   - Prune lightly to maintain the shape and structure of the plant without causing stress.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Control**:\n   - Inspect the plant for signs of pests like spider mites or aphids, which can cause similar symptoms. If pests are present, treat them promptly with an appropriate pesticide.\n   - Check for signs of disease such as rust or blight, which can affect the leaves and flowers. If you suspect a disease, consult a professional for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n6. **Soil Amendments**:\n   - Improve soil drainage if the plant seems to be sitting in waterlogged soil. Add perl",

These are brought on by heat and dry stress to the tree, but usually won't kill your tree.  As the leaves fall from the tree, rake them and dispose of them so they don't re-infect them next year.  Fungicides are usually not effective on these diseases.  Keep an eye on them next year, water appropriately (without over watering) and hopefully they will grow big and beautiful.  If you do experience this next year, please bring a sample into the local office and I will help you determine a course of action.  Look for full leaf development too. \u00a0<br><br>See this publication: \u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2831/EPP-7634web.pdf\">http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2831/EPP-7634web.pdf</a><br><br>",

Given that the tree was planted less than a year ago and experienced a very hot summer, it's possible that the tree may still be adjusting to its new environment.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for the issue observed:\n\n1. **Monitor Watering**: Ensure the tree receives adequate water, especially during dry spells. Western redbuds prefer moist soil but do not tolerate standing water. Consider setting up a drip irrigation system if necessary.\n\n2. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Avoid piling mulch too close to the trunk to prevent stem rot.\n\n3. **Pruning**: Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth. This can also help reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Use a slow-release, balanced fertilizer designed for trees. Over-fertilizing can cause root burn, especially in young plants.\n\n5. **Pest Control**: Inspect the plant regularly for signs of pests. If pests are present, identify them and use appropriate chemical or biological controls. For small infestations, hand-picking can be effective.\n\n6. **Disease Management**: If disease is suspected, consult with a local horticulturist or extension agent for specific recommendations. They can provide guidance on identifying the exact type of disease and the best treatment options, which may include fungicides or other treatments.\n\n7. **Stress Reduction**: Provide additional shade if possible to protect the tree from direct sunlight during hot afternoons. Shade cloth can be used to moderate the light exposure.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help the tree recover from the stress of recent conditions and improve its overall health.",

The management strategy for this weed can be approached from several angles:\n\n### Mechanical Control:\n1. **Manual Removal**: Regularly pull the weeds by hand, especially when they are young and before they have set seed. Be sure to remove the entire taproot to prevent regrowth.\n2. **Mowing**: Frequent mowing can help control the spread of the weed by preventing it from setting seeds and allowing grass to compete more effectively.\n\n### Chemical Control:\n1. **Herbicides**: Use selective herbicides specifically designed for broadleaf weeds like Prunella. Common active ingredients include imazapyr (e.g., Arsenal\u00ae) or bentazon (e.g., Prowl\u00ae). Apply these chemicals according to the label instructions, ensuring that you do not apply them during flowering or seed set to avoid harming beneficial insects or other desirable plants.\n2. **Pre-emergent Herbicides**: Apply pre-emergent herbicides to prevent the germination of seeds in the soil. These can be effective in controlling future infestations but should be used with caution to avoid affecting desired grass species.\n\n### Cultural Control:\n1. **Healthy Lawn**: A healthy, well-maintained lawn can outcompete weeds. Ensure your lawn receives proper watering, fertilization, and mowing practices.\n2. **Mulching**: Applying a layer of mulch around trees and shrubs can help suppress weed growth by reducing light availability to the seeds.\n\n### Integrated Pest Management (IPM):\n1. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the lawn for signs of weed invasion and act promptly. Early detection is key to effective control.\n2. **Biological Control**: Investigate if there are biological controls available for Prunella vulgaris. Some natural predators may help reduce populations over time.\n\n### Prevention:\n1. **Seeds and Soil**: Avoid introducing new seeds into your lawn by cleaning garden tools and equipment after use. Also, check and clean your lawn mower blades before mowing.\n2. **Avoid Disturbance**: Minimize disturbances in your lawn to prevent seeds from germinating and establishing themselves.\n\nBy combining mechanical, chemical, and cultural methods, along with regular monitoring and prevention strategies, you can effectively manage the spread of Prunella vulgaris in your lawn.

How fortunate to inherit\u00a0granite walls and some nice plants in your landscape!<br /> While it may seem that your Mountain Laurel are responsible, it is not likely.

Here are some recommended strategies for managing American Burnweed:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: This is often the most effective method for controlling small infestations. Manual pulling or digging is effective when the plant is young and has not yet set seed. Be sure to remove the entire taproot to prevent regrowth.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices**: Regular mowing and maintaining healthy competition from other plants can help prevent the spread of American Burnweed by reducing its ability to establish itself in disturbed areas.\n\n3. **Herbicides**: If physical removal is impractical, herbicides like glyphosate (Roundup) or dicamba can be used. It's important to apply these chemicals carefully, following the label instructions to avoid harming desirable plants and to ensure effectiveness.\n\n4. **Biological Control**: While there are no known biological controls for American Burnweed, research is ongoing to identify potential natural enemies.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures**: If you're planting seeds in your garden, consider using a seed mix that is known to contain no invasive species. Regular monitoring and quick intervention can help prevent small infestations from becoming larger problems.\n\n6. **Community Efforts**: If you suspect American Burnweed has spread beyond your property, it's beneficial to report sightings to local conservation organizations or government agencies responsible for managing invasive species.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage the presence of American Burnweed in your area. Always prioritize safety when using chemical controls and consult with local experts for tailored advice on your specific situation.",

                "response": "<p><strong>Hello Denise,</strong></p> <p><strong>Based on the leaf litter (oak leaves) that is on the ground at the base of the trees and the bark on the trees - it looks like an oak tree in the black oak family. And also based on what I see in your images this looks like Bacterial Wetwood Or Slime Flux on these trees<br /> <br /> What causes Bacterial Wetwood? Bacterial wetwood is a bacterial infection that causes a profuse flow (flux) of sap from trunk wounds or pruning cuts. It is characterized by light or dark-colored vertical streaks of residue on tree bark. The infection, also known as slime flux, causes the leaves of the upper crown to wilt and drop prematurely, as well as potentially kill tree branches. A foul-smelling sap that is toxic to vegetation and ground cover is often seen bubbling from an infected tree.<br /> <br /> Bacterial Wetwood Or Slime Flux: Many mature trees, including elms, oak, tulip poplar, and maple, exhibit large light or dark vertical streaks on their trunks. These vertical streaks result from a slimy liquid oozing out of cracks or wounds and running down the bark called 'slime flux'. Sometimes this liquid is very abundant and foul-smelling. If an affected tree is cut down, the heartwood is darker in color than the surrounding wood, thus the name 'wetwood'. Although the symptoms are unsightly, little damage is done to the tree in most situations. However, if affected trees are under severe stress from other factors such as soil compaction, wetwood bacteria can move into the sapwood and cause leaf yellowing, wilting, and branch dieback.<br /> </strong><br /> <strong>Symptoms and Signs</strong><br /> </p> <p><strong>- Light or dark streaks on the bark originate at a crack or wound and run vertically down the trunk</strong></p> <p><strong>- Slimy, sometimes foul-smelling liquid bubbles out of the tree and runs down the trunk</strong></p> <p><strong>- Heartwood deep in the interior of the tree is much darker than surrounding sapwood.</strong></p> <p><strong>Cause and Effects</strong></p> <p><strong>Bacteria, commonly found in soil and water, take up residence in young trees or gain entrance to older trees through wounds. The bacteria, including species of Clostridium, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas, grow within the tree using the sap as a nutrient source. As the sap is used, oxygen in the heartwood is depleted (creating anaerobic conditions), methane is produced, the pH of the sap is increased (pH 6 in healthy trees to pH 7 to 8 in wetwood), and a high pressure develops in the wood (60 psi in affected trees vs. 5-10 psi in wetwood-free trees). The resulting environment greatly inhibits the growth of fungi that can cause interior rots. The liquid kills grass and other herbaceous plants that it contacts at the base of the tree. The wood of affected trees has greatly reduced value as lumber because of the unsightly discoloration. Affected wood dries much more slowly than wood taken from wetwood-free trees.<br /> </strong><strong><br /> Management</strong></p> <p><strong>- Avoid wounding the tree.</strong></p> <p><strong>- Protect the tree from other stresses, especially soil compaction from vehicles or pedestrians.</strong></p> <p><strong>Many years ago, it was thought that the pressure within the tree should be relieved. Holes were drilled into the trunks of affected trees and pipes were inserted to allow the liquid and gases to escape. This is no longer recommended because 1) affected trees generally survive well without any treatment and 2) drilling holes in the tree creates yet another place where slime oozes out. There is no preventive treatment or way to eliminate wetwood from an affected tree.

The sap begins to rise and if there is a wound is runs out of the wounded bark. This phenomenon has been exploited for centuries and is why we are able to have maple syrup on our pancakes. The good news is your tree will be fine. You may want to wash the sap off of the bark this spring so it doesn't attract wasps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

There are small white encasements/nodules on smaller stems of the trees (pic attached), and there are numerous small fist-sized webs on leaves at the end of the branches.  When I pick one of the white masses off and turn it over, I see a red spec on the bottom side of the mass.  Could these be spider mites?  I don't observe any insects directly in the webs themselves.  I have been removing these white masses by hand but am probably not finding all of them.  I have Neem Oil if that is an appropriate treatment for these insects.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

The waxy covering protects the insect and eggs laid beneath, which you saw. \u00a0If you only have a small amount, you can continue to\u00a0scrape off the ones you have.\u00a0<br /> Otherwise, the treatment timing is once eggs hatch and crawlers begin\u00a0moving, which can be tricky to identify.<br /> Here is our page on this scale:\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/indian-wax-scale\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/indian-wax-scale</a><br /> <br /> The webbing you see are spider-related, and they are great to have in the garden and should be conserved.

Weather or wildlife might have knocked it down, and we would not expect the wasps to rebuild since these colonies die out by the end of autumn anyway. Even if it hadn't fallen, nests are not re-used from year to year.\u00a0(Only new queens survive the winter;\u00a0they disperse away from the nest of their birth\u00a0and overwinter by themselves in a sheltered location; each of those females will start a new nest by herself in spring.) If any wasps remain with this nest after it fell, they may be defensive and likely to sting intruders that come too close (or if someone runs a lawn mower too close, as the vibrations may alarm them), but otherwise the nest is harmless if ignored and given a wide berth. Wildlife such as\u00a0birds, perhaps skunks, squirrels, etc., may also tear into its paper-like covering\u00a0to eat any immature wasps or even the adults themselves; sometimes adult hornets are also preyed-upon by other hornets (such as European Hornets). It's possible this is an old nest from last year and as such\u00a0is already abandoned...it's hard to tell, since they tend to disintegrate on their own during winter and the following year, so maybe that's why it fell; if that's the case, it should be unused and able to be removed.<br /> <br /> Miri",

Can you confirm this or give an alternative diagnosis, please</div></blockquote> <p>Hi,\u00a0</p> <p>Thank you for contacting Master Gardeners.\u00a0It certainly looks like powdery mildew and perhaps insect damage as well.\u00a0Frustrating to have this after just 10 days, but the the weather, at least in Franklin County, is part of the problem.\u00a0<br /><br />Powdery mildew fungi thrive with cool, humid nights that stimulate spore production and warm (70 to 80 F), dry days that allow for spore spread. Powdery mildew fungi produce a mat of fungal growth on the surface of the plant.</p> <p>To correct:</p> <p>Plant in sunny areas as much as possible, provide good air circulation, and avoid applying excess fertilizer.</p> <p>If powdery mildew is noticed on a few leaves, simply removing them will help with control. At the end of the growing season, prune out infected stems and remove fallen leaves, which can serve as a source of further infection.</p> <p>Powdery mildew can be mitigated by spraying the plant's foliage with either baking soda or milk, and both methods are effective. Nonetheless, a 2007 study found foliar milk sprays were more effective than baking soda in preventing powdery mildew.</p> <p>The leaves also look like there is insect damage. Take a close look on the underneath of the leaves. Many insects feed on the aster foliage, including leaf beetles, the larvae of leaf-mining flies and fruit flies, plant bugs, stink bugs, lace bugs, aphids, leafhoppers, and the caterpillars of several butterfly and moth species.Japanese beetles seem to have invaded Ohio recently. Look for them as well.</p> <p>If you see Japanese beetles tip them off the plant into a small container of water and suffocate them and if you find other any insects mix a quart of water with a teaspoon of dish soap. Once you mix the water with dish soap, the least \u201ctouchy\u201d solution is to pour the soapy water into a spray bottle and spray the beetles on your affected plants or use insecticidal soap. Do this early in the day not hot sunshine.</p> <p>Resources:</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/powdery-mildew-flower-gardenhttps://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/powdery-mildew/\">https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/powdery-mildew-flower-gardenhttps://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/powdery-mildew/</a></p>",

Here is a photo of similar Reticulitermes specimen for comparison...<br /><a href=\"https://bugguide.net/node/view/1964822\">https://bugguide.net/node/view/1964822</a><br /><br />I have seen the winged forms of these termites flying in Corvallis in the last week or two, so it seems like this is a good time of year for them to swarm. The ones you see that are linked in pairs are mating and preparing for the females to start new colonies. These types of termites nest in the soil and feed on wood in contact with the soil, but can secondarily invade structural wood in buildings and can be quite damaging. Since you are consistently seeing lots of these termites on your house year after year, it might be good to err on the side of caution and have a knowledgeable, licensed pest control operator do a termite inspection. Hopefully, you don't have an infestation in the wood of your house, and the ones you are seeing are just reproductive termites from surrounding colonies in the soil. But if you do have an infestation, it would be a good idea to take care of it to protect your home.<br /><br />Best wishes!",

                "response": "Thank you for the information. Sod webworm larvae damage plants above the crown and root damage would not be typical. There are diseases that can affect the roots of plants as well as insects. Also, certain weedy species like creeping bentgrass have very shallow roots that do not tolerate drought.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Sod webworm is most often a problem in turf that is not irrigated. Ensuring the turf is healthy will enable it to tolerate sod webworm damage without treatment. Provide adequate but not excessive moisture and nutrient\u00a0applications and mow at 3-4 inches. It is not recommended to treat based on moth numbers since their larvae have high mortality rates. Before pursuing treatment, sample a section to confirm the presence of larvae. \"Push through any damaged areas with your fingers and look for patches of turf that are pruned off just above the crowns. Look for small sawdust-like, green pellets (frass) that turn brown in a few days. Larvae can be brought to the surface by drenching infested turf with a soapy water solution made by stirring 1 oz of liquid dishwashing soap into 3 gallons of water. Pour this solution over a strip of turfgrass 1 foot wide by 6 feet long. Watch for larvae to come to the surface within 2 to 10 minutes after applying the drench.\" (<a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/diseases/sod-webworm#gallery\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/diseases/sod-webworm#gallery</a>). This can be done a couple of weeks after the moths are observed.<br /> <br /> If many caterpillars are observed during the flush test and you are getting unacceptable levels of damage to the turf, you may wish to pursue management options. You can use biologicals such as BTK or beneficial nematodes (<a href=\"https://ag.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/sod-webworms\">https://ag.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/sod-webworms</a>). Chemical options are available. Mow\u00a0the yard first to remove any flowering plants from the turf you will be treating to avoid damaging pollinators.

Although some of the newer cultivars are supposed to be more tolerant of fluctuating weather conditions, broccoli is temperamental. Persistent cold and hot temperatures and wildly fluctuating temperatures induce bolting. It's best to wait till at least mid-April to plant.\u00a0<br><br>Using row covers is a good practice. They can provide 2-6 degrees F. of protection. This may not be enough when we have cold spring weather. In other years unseasonably high temperatures can actually increase the temperature under the covers inflicting heat stress and bolting. The good news is that you have healthy plants that should continue to produce side shoots into June.<br>Jon\u00a0",

                "answer": "The image shows a broccoli plant that appears to be at an advanced stage of flowering and fruiting, which is normal as broccoli plants naturally transition from leafy growth to flowering after they have been harvested or when the main head is removed. However, if the goal was to continue growing new heads (which is typical for broccoli), the flowers should be removed to redirect energy back into leaf and stem growth.\n\nHere are some management strategies you can consider:\n\n1. **Remove Flowers**: Once the main head has been harvested, remove any flowers that develop on the plant. This will prevent the plant from going to seed prematurely and will allow it to continue producing more side shoots.\n\n2. **Pruning**: If you want to encourage more side shoots, you can prune the plant by removing the top portion above where the main head was cut. This will stimulate additional growth points and encourage more side shoots to form.\n\n3. **Mulching**: Ensure the soil around your broccoli plants is well-mulched to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. This can also provide additional nutrients to the soil as the mulch decomposes.\n\n4. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during periods of hot weather, as broccoli prefers evenly moist soil.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 ratio, every few weeks to provide the necessary nutrients for continued growth.\n\n6. **Pest Management**: Inspect the plants regularly for pests like aphids or caterpillars, and treat them promptly if necessary using organic or chemical pesticides as appropriate.\n\n7. **Support**: If the plant becomes tall and lanky, consider staking it with a wooden stake to support its structure and prevent lodging.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to manage the flowering stage and encourage the broccoli plant to produce multiple heads.",

While blooming and producing cherries, the tree probably needs about 1 inch of water per week, and we had an exceptionally dry spring. Most of us just crossed our fingers and hoped it would rain, and of course our trees suffered and are showing the consequences- like leaf drop. <br /><br />I also notice the strange twisting around the trunk of your tree which makes me think the previous owners might have let a couple of stump sprouts grow up and around, probably not the healthiest way to grow a tree. <br /><br />With such a beautiful tree, and if you don't see signs of a fungus infection (sap pockets on the trunk or branches, shot-hole spots on the leaves) I would just give it some extra water around the drip line (farthest area where the branches would drip water) while this heat lasts, and rake up the fallen leaves in case there is a fungus at work. A soaker hose running for an hour or so would be ideal, as the grass will get the first of the water and you want it to go deeper to the tree roots.<br /><br />The tree will let you know if it is giving up the fight. Sometimes an extra large crop of fruit is a signal that it is highly stressed. It's probably time to be thinking about what you would replace the tree with if it can't recover this year. I know that would be sad.<br /><br />Best of luck with the extra care this summer,<br /><br />",

                "answer": "The image shows a cherry tree with leaves that appear to be yellowing, which could indicate chlorosis (iron deficiency), nutrient deficiencies, or disease. Given the context provided, where the tree has experienced a larger-than-usual fruit crop and has been watered weekly, it's important to consider potential issues related to overwatering, nutrient imbalances, or disease.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Assess Soil Nutrient Levels**: Have the soil tested to determine if there are any nutrient deficiencies. This can help identify if iron deficiency, calcium deficiency, or other nutrient imbalances are contributing to the leaf discoloration.\n\n2. **Check for Disease**: Look for signs of disease such as bacterial leaf spot or fungal infections that might cause the leaves to turn yellow. Symptoms of these diseases include spots on the leaves, discolored areas, or leaf drop.\n\n3. **Adjust Watering Schedule**: Since the tree has been receiving regular water, consider whether the watering frequency is appropriate for its needs. Overwatering can lead to root rot and nutrient deficiencies, as excess water can wash nutrients out of the soil.\n\n4. **Apply Fertilizer**: Based on the soil test results, apply appropriate fertilizers. For example, if iron deficiency is found, applying an iron chelate fertilizer might help. Make sure to follow the application instructions carefully to avoid over-fertilization.\n\n5. **Prune for Health**: Prune the tree to remove any dead or diseased branches. Proper pruning also helps maintain the structure of the tree and encourages new growth.\n\n6. **Monitor for Pests**: Check for pests such as aphids or spider mites, which can contribute to leaf yellowing and other issues.

One has been coming for the last week that is missing all the fur on the first two inches of it's tail - all the way around. The skin again looks fiery red and sometimes weepy.\nI know some of these bald patches could be down to injury or fighting, but the borders seem to be uniform in shape with every hair gone.\nDoes this sound like mange? If so, is there any way to treat it that isn't hands-on? If not, is there any way to treat whatever else it is that doesn't require hands-on?\nIf there is nothing I can do, will this eventually burn through the entire population and then start over with immune squirrels?

Grown squirrels are likely to come through this and survive just fine. If this was happening just at the start of fall/winter cold weather however, the hair loss might be tougher for them to bear. <br>\nUnnaturally close density and frequent use of the same spots, such as at feeders, helps spread conditions like this. At this point, the squirrels are obviously food-conditioned to use the reliable source of food your feeders are providing, so we don't want to cut them off cold-turkey as it were. If you can instead create more numerous, smaller, well-dispersed feeding stations, that might help reduce the community transmission rate. <br>\nAs you're able to this spring and summer, consider creating bird-feeding stations that don't double (directly or through spillage) as squirrel-feeders - Consider if it's possible to do some plantings (e.g., spruces, pines, willows, aspens, others) that will provide natural foods for the squirrels but will keep them at a more natural\u00a0 distance from each other while they seek and obtain food.

                "answer": "The image shows a row of arborvitae trees with dense, healthy foliage at the top but appears to have some lower branches that are dying or sparse. This is a common issue with arborvitae, often referred to as \"tip burn\" or \"dieback,\" which can be caused by several factors such as overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiencies, pests, or environmental stress.\n\nGiven the location and time provided (Washington County, Oregon, March 2023), the following management strategies could be recommended:\n\n1. **Water Management**: Ensure consistent watering. Arborvitae can be susceptible to both drought and waterlogged conditions. Check the soil moisture levels regularly and adjust irrigation accordingly to prevent excessive wetting of the roots, which can lead to root rot, and ensure the soil remains moist enough to prevent the tree from drying out.\n\n2. **Fertilization**: Evaluate the soil for nutrient deficiencies. Arborvitae require a balanced diet of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. A soil test can help determine if fertilization is needed. Apply fertilizer according to the recommendations from your local Cooperative Extension Service, ensuring not to over-fertilize, as excess nitrogen can promote overly lush growth that may be more susceptible to diseases.\n\n3. **Pruning**: While the upper parts appear healthy, consider pruning to remove any dead or diseased branches. This will help promote better air circulation and reduce the risk of disease spread. Prune during the dormant season, typically late winter or early spring, to avoid stressing the tree unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Pest Control**: Check for signs of pests such as scale insects or mites, which can contribute to the dieback. If pests are present, identify the specific type and follow the recommended control measures, which may include using insecticides or biological controls.\n\n5. **Disease Management**: Inspect the lower parts of the trees for signs of diseases. If diseases are suspected, consult with a horticulturist or an extension agent for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n6. **Mulching**: Add a layer of mulch around the base of the trees to retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. However, keep the mulch away from the trunk to prevent potential issues with root rot.\n\n7. **Monitor for Environmental Stress**: Check for signs of environmental stress, such as excessive heat or cold, wind, or poor air quality, which can affect the health of the trees. If environmental conditions are not ideal, consider ways to mitigate these stresses",

Cultural control is to snip off the infected leaves and toss them in the garbage. Increase airflow around the plants. Growing them up a trellis does help with drying out the leaves.

        "question": "Hello! I recently purchased a home in Zone 8 (97116) which has an extensive and neglected rose bed in front of it. Some of the roses have canes that are black with cancerous-looking lesions on them (see attached), but not all of them have this. However, ALL of them are at summer height and were not cut down in the fall. Is it too late to cut them down, and if not too late, how do I do that (how high do I leave them, etc.)? I am a first-time rose owner and wasn't sure if this was too late into winter and might harm the roses. Also, will cutting off the individually-affected cancerous canes (after trimming all the healthy ones) be adequate, or should I just plan to destroy those bushes with the disease in their entirety?

Encouraging turfgrass density in the fall and spring should be fairly effective for limiting the presence of woodsorrel in turfed areas. Yellow woodsorrel is most likely to invade when spring conditions have opened the turf from drought or grub damage. Woodsorrel is a late-germinating summer annual, ideally suited to fill-in voids in the turf during June, July and August.</p><p>Several preemergence crabgrass herbicides have activity on yellow woodsorrel. Unfortunately, a higher concentration of herbicide is necessary for woodsorrel suppression. In areas with heavy pressure it may be advisable to make a split application of crabgrass preemergence to ensure that the concentration of herbicide is high enough during the germination window. Prodiamine, pendimethalin and dithiopyr all provide some suppression of woodsorrel. Once established, postemergence control is not reliably found in traditional broadleaf herbicides. Most postemergence activity is further diminished due to the hot-dry conditions of summer. However, products containing triclopyr or carfentrazone have shown promise in several trials. Traditional two- and three-way combination broadleaf herbicides will probably not be effective on yellow woodsorrel.\u201d</p><p>Disclaimer: Always read, understand, and follow the label directions.

        "question": "Can you identify what is happening to these Concord grapes?  Years ago someone told me it was probably black spot and to severely prune back and dispose of the vines.  I've done that a couple times over the years.  When I did a light pruning over the past week or so there were more types of tiny creepy and flying things than I could count!  At this point I'm wondering if it's a pest, and not a fungus.\n\nMost years I lose a lot of grapes in the beginning of the season because they turn dark (the wrong way) and start to wither.  And then at some point during the summer the spots seem to suddenly stop forming and a decent amount of grapes are still produced.  Also at some point the Japanese beetles will come and eat the leaves.  Right now the rose bushes next to the grape vines also have leaves that have been eaten extensively by something I don't see.\n\nAny advice on how to keep the grapes growing is appreciated!  Also, children will be picking and eating the grapes all summer (ripe or not!), so I need to be careful that any medications are reasonably safe.\n\nThank you!",

The house has a white exterior with a red roof. A portion of the house's porch or deck is also visible, along with a chair placed on it.\n\n3. **Garden Area**: To the right of the house, there appears to be a garden or yard area with dry grass, some green plants, and a few scattered rocks.\n\n4. **Seasonal Context**: The presence of bare branches suggests that it might be late winter or early spring, as there are no leaves on many of the trees. There are hints of new growth, indicating the beginning of spring.\n\n5. **Lighting**: The image was taken during the evening, as indicated by the timestamp. The lighting is soft, with the sky showing a light blue hue, suggesting either dusk or dawn.\n\n6. **Sky and Weather**: The sky is partly cloudy, allowing for some sunlight to filter through the branches, creating a dappled effect on the scene below.\n\nOverall, the image provides a tranquil view of a suburban area in Ramsey County, Minnesota, captured at the transition between winter and spring.",

You may also be\nobserving browning of leaves on other broadleaved evergreens such as azaleas,\nrhododendrons, hollies, grape-holly, euonymous and mountain laurel. (These\nplants, like boxwood, bear leaves that normally stay green all year.) This\nbrowning, also known as desiccation, occurs when winter winds draw moisture out\nof the plant tissue. Since the temperatures have been so extreme, these\nshallow-rooted plants cannot draw any more water from the frozen ground to\nreplace the water lost by the leaves. You will especially see desiccation on\nthe windward side of plants as the air draws moisture from the leaves as it\npasses by. If the roots cannot pull up any water, the water that transpired\nfrom the leaves cannot be replaced; therefore, these cells die causing brown\ntissue.\n<br>\nOnce\nthe snow melts, you can see the differences in shrubs or plants that were\npartially snow-covered. The portion of shrub that was covered in snow was\ninsulated against the colder temperatures and wind, thus did not suffer as\nsevere burn.\n<br>\nWill these plants survive? It depends on\nthe severity of the damage. Be sure to wait until after shrubs leaf out if you\nare unsure whether or not a branch is still living. Check to see if there are\nany live buds. You don\u2019t want to cut these off. Exposure to this winter\u2019s\nextreme temperatures may have caused delay in leaf development on plants, so if\nyou prune as early as you would after a normal winter, you may be cutting off\nlive growth. The extreme temperatures that we\u2019ve experienced may also cause\nbuds and entire branches to die. Don\u2019t be surprised if you also see some plants\nstart to leaf out but then collapse. Corrective pruning along with recommended\nfertilization and proper watering will often help these plants recover.\n\n\u00a0\n<br>\nThis is a\ngood article from Missouri Botanical Garden:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/hortline.asp?code=3959\" target=\"\" rel=\"\">http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/hortline.asp?code=3959</a>\n<br>\nI hope this\nwas helpful.

Here's some more information:\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/woolly-aphids-trees/\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/woolly-aphids-trees/</a></p> <p>In the outdoors, wooly aphids are typically controlled\u00a0by parasitic wasps, however since your problem is significant, it is recommended to use either horticulture oil or insecticidal soap to reduce the infestation. A commercial brand of insecticidal soap would be the safest insecticide to use.\u00a0</p> <p>However given the very hot weather this week I want to flag that\u00a0insecticidal soap should not be applied when temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, so it would be best to apply in early morning on a cooler day -- it looks like next Thursday temperatures will drop somewhat so that might be a wise option. <a href=\"https://ccenassau.org/resources/-insecticidal-soap#:~:text=Apply%20when%20the%20temperature%20is,is%20in%20the%20early%20morning.\">Here's more information</a> from Cornell Extension on applying insecticidal soap.</p> <p>All my best,\u00a0</p> <p>Rebecca<br /></p> ",

                "response": " <p>These look like they could be one of the\u00a0woolly aphids, which often have two host plants, i.e. elm and serviceberry. They overwinter and begin their breeding cycle on the primary host, raising a generation with wings. This winged generation flies to the secondary host plant, such as\u00a0your serviceberry,\u00a0to feed for the summer, ending that phase by raising\u00a0another generation with wings\u00a0to fly back to a primary host plant.</p> <p>The good news is that trees generally withstand woolly aphids fairly well. The bad news is that WA multiply very rapidly.\u00a0</p> <p>Good that you spotted the problem early!\u00a0Suggest literally knocking down the population by hosing\u00a0all of the tree you can reach with a firm spray. Monitor the serviceberry and spray treatments can be repeated\u00a0as needed, if needed.<br /></p> <p>Although their waxy coat that gives them a \u201cwoolly\u201d appearance protects WA from horticultural oils, soaps and even permethrin, a jet of water can dislodge them.</p> <p>WA have many natural predators in the garden, which can keep the reduced population in check. \u00a0<br /></p> <p>How to boost the natural predator population in your garden:</p> <p>A practice to attract natural predators to your garden is to include flowering native and herb plants in your garden. Another is to draw in small insectivorous birds with a shallow birdbath of fresh water (changed every other day &amp; kept clean) and nesting spots.\u00a0Hummingbirds might be more attracted to a bath with a drip, spray or small fountain.</p> <p><br />Unfortunately, some sucking insects can sometimes carry plant pathogens from a plant that is already affected to another plant. So continue to monitor, as you have been, to reduce that risk by keeping the populations down.\u00a0<br /></p> <p>More details in the link below:</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/aphids#use-a-high-pressure-water-spray-344411\">https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/aphids#use-a-high-pressure-water-spray-344411</a></p> <p><br />Please keep us posted on your serviceberry!</p> <p>Kate</p> ",

Filled both with top soil from our local Waste-Pro and planted tomatoes and basil. The tomatoes have been growing well until recently when the new leaves began to curl up (see image). Initially we thought it was aphids but we don't have any insects on/in the curled up leaves. We looked up some possibilities online and consulted with a local friend who gardens a lot. Both sources point towards herbicide contamination but we haven't sprayed and the plants haven't been exposed to over-spray from neighboring fields/properties.

Areas of Anne Arundel County can have sandy soil which ants prefer. The lawn looks like it could be thickened up and it is mowed a bit too shorts. Ants love to have easy access to soil.<br>If you want to try to rectify the situation it would take some work on your lawn. Testing the soil, adding organic matter, reseeding in the fall to thicken up the grass, or even laying sod. You should keep the area mowed to about 3-4 inches. All of this might help but is not a guarantee they will go away because this happens each year.<br>Deb\u00a0",

Based on the symptoms visible, such as the robust root system and elongated leaves, it may be a type of crabgrass or another similar weed that invades lawns.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Identification**: Confirm the exact species of the weed by comparing it to known invasive grasses like crabgrass, quackgrass, or Johnson grass. This can help tailor the treatment method more effectively.\n\n2. **Mechanical Removal**: For smaller infestations, hand-pulling or using a small trowel to dig out the roots can be effective. Ensure you remove the entire root system to prevent regrowth.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Pre-Emergent Herbicides**: Apply these before the weed seeds germinate (usually in late winter or early spring) to prevent seed germination. Common pre-emergent herbicides include trifluralin and pendimethalin.\n   - **Post-Emergent Herbicides**: If the infestation is already established, post-emergent herbicides like glyphosate (Roundup) or clopyralid can be used to kill the existing plants. Ensure you follow the label instructions carefully and avoid applying during periods of drought or high temperatures.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Healthy Lawn**: Maintain a healthy lawn through proper mowing, watering, and fertilizing practices. A strong, dense lawn can help outcompete weeds.\n   - **Aerate**: Regularly aerating the lawn helps improve soil health, which can make the grass more competitive against weeds.\n   - **Watering**: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep-rooted grass, which is less susceptible to weed invasion.\n\n5. **Re-Seeding**: If the area is heavily infested and cannot be managed by other means, consider re-seeding the area with tall fescue or another desirable grass species to create a dense cover that discourages weed growth.\n\n6. **Consult Local Experts**: Since the problem is specific to Howard County, Maryland, consulting with local extension agents or landscapers who are familiar with the local environment and conditions can provide tailored advice.\n\nBy implementing a combination of mechanical, chemical, and cultural control measures, you can effectively manage the invasion of this grass species in your lawn. It's important to act promptly to prevent the spread and establishment of invasive weeds.",

                "answer": "The plant in the image appears to be pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), which can be identified by its leaves, stems, and small white flowers. Pokeweed is a common invasive species that can become problematic in disturbed areas such as those created by fallen trees like the oak that occurred in Prince George's County, Maryland.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Manual Removal**:\n   - Pokeweed can be manually pulled from the ground when it is small or seedlings are emerging. Be sure to remove the entire root system to prevent re-growth. This method is effective but labor-intensive, especially on larger patches.\n\n2. **Herbicides**:\n   - For larger infestations or areas where manual removal is impractical, herbicides can be used. Selective herbicides that target broadleaf weeds, such as dicamba or triclopyr, can be applied directly to the plants. It\u2019s important to follow the label instructions carefully to avoid damage to desirable plants or unintended consequences.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - Regularly monitoring and managing the area can help prevent the spread of pokeweed. Clearing away debris and maintaining healthy native vegetation can reduce the habitat suitable for pokeweed growth.\n\n4. **Biological Control**:\n   - While not widely available or practical for home use, some species of insects and pathogens are natural enemies of pokeweed. If you are interested in biological control, consulting with local extension services may provide information on their availability and effectiveness.\n\n5. **Preventative Measures**:\n   - Planting competitive native species in the area can help suppress the growth of pokeweed. Native plants often outcompete invasives due to their ability to thrive in the local environment and provide habitat for beneficial insects.\n\n6. **Regular Maintenance**:\n   - Continuous maintenance, including regular mowing and weeding, can help keep the area free of pokeweed and other unwanted invasive species.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Always ensure proper safety measures are taken when using herbicides, as they can be harmful to both people and the environment if not used correctly.\n- Consider seeking professional assistance for large-scale infestations or areas with significant tree damage.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage the pokeweed population around the oak stump in your backyard.",

Our Linden tree (approximately 20+ years old) is starting to lose its leaves well ahead of other trees in this area.  I was wondering if the tree may be in a sort of shock and if there is anything we should be doing to help it through the winter.  We don't notice any unusual signs of blight, etc., but the tree did lose one medium sized limb during the storm. We are grateful we kept it, as the entire tree was bent at an extraordinary angle during the storm.  ",

There is a good chance that your tree was bothered by the Japanese beetle this year and that would be the cause of the leaves starting to fall off.  Japanese beetles will leave the leaf looking like a doilies.  This time of the year there is nothing that can be done about the beetles.  You want to make sure that the limb that came out from the storm is cleaned up.  You don't want any jagged wood sticking out or anything of that nature.  The flower bed around the tree is a concern.  When we put extra soil around the base of the tree it could suffocate the roots that are directly under it.  Also that soil up against the tree can rot out the trunk.  If possible we would recommend removing the bed all together and put in mulch.  Mulch allows air to flow and suppresses weed competition.  The middle picture shows some wire or other material that may be looped around the trunks.  Make sure that it isn't too tight to cause any damage.  Check it periodically and adjust it accordingly to make sure the tree does not try to grow around it. \u00a0 <br><br>More information about storm damaged trees: <a href=\"http://nfs.unl.edu/Storm%20Damage%20series%20Mobile.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://nfs.unl.edu/Storm%20Damage%20series%20Mobile.pdf</a><br><br>More information about Japanese beetles: <a href=\"http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/japanese-beetles/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/japanese-beetles/</a><br><br>Please let me know if you have other questions. <br><br><br>",

Looks like the herbicide they used was applied correctly but too close to the fence. Ask your neighbor to let you know when they are spraying the lawn so you can protect your plants from damage from spraying their lawn. You can also try washing the plants off if you see them spraying the lawn to prevent the herbicide from attaching to the leaf of the plants and being drawn into the plant and starting the killing of the plant. Most herbicides are systemic so they take the herbicide in thru the leaves.</p>",

As far as protecting your plants the next time is to find out the schedule for the spraying of the herbicide and to place a barrier between the fence and your plants. I would use a roll of clear\u00a0plastic barrier wire tied to the fence. I would ask your neighbor not to spray near the fence. If all that fails try asking the person that is applying the herbicide to use another or different herbicide that will not kill your plants.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I hope this answers your question.</p>",

So, it is just an aesthetic issue. The affected leaves can be cut out if they are really bothersome, but it is not necessary.<br /> <br /> The distortion is caused by chemical secretions produced during feeding or egg laying. The chemicals act like natural plant growth hormones. The leaves only become distorted when the leaf is attacked early in the growing season when it is rapidly expanding. Fully expanded leaves do not have the same reaction.<br /> <br /> Below are two links with additional information that you may find helpful.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://agsci.colostate.edu/agbio/ipm-pests/eriophyid-mites-2/\">https://agsci.colostate.edu/agbio/ipm-pests/eriophyid-mites-2/</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/insects/insect-and-mite-galls-5-577/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/insects/insect-and-mite-galls-5-577/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> ",

I have applied mole-ex to my lawn along with bait boxes for voles but so far damage has continued. I had my grass aerated in the Spring - fertilized- grub control and had a nice lawn until about a month ago. Started looking a little yellow but thought maybe it was over fertilized. Last week the damage in the first picture showed up so I was told I have moles or voles and then put the mole -ex on lawn along with a fungus control suggested to me by gardening place. After that all the other holes and damage has continued day after day. I am besides myself and don't know what to do. Please help!!!!",

These plants are planted near the fence and appear healthy and well-maintained.\n\n3. **Mulch**: Black mulch is present between the base of the fence and the grass, likely used for landscaping purposes.\n\n4. **Grass Lawn**: A neatly trimmed green lawn occupies the lower right portion of the image. The grass looks short and well-maintained.\n\n5. **Blue Trampoline**: In the bottom left corner, part of a blue trampoline is visible, suggesting a recreational area within the yard.\n\n6. **Sky**: The sky in the background is clear and blue, indicating that it was a sunny day at the time the photo was taken.\n\n7. **Building**: Part of a building with a gray roof is visible on the upper left side of the image, suggesting it might be an attached garage or part of the house's exterior.\n\nThe overall setting gives a sense of a well-maintained residential outdoor space in a suburban environment.",

                "answer": "The image shows a peach tree branch with buds that appear to be either dead or dying, which could be indicative of frost damage from the unusually cold winter conditions in Jefferson County, Colorado. Frost damage often results in dead buds and shoots, and it can affect the overall health and productivity of the tree.\n\nHere is a recommended management strategy for this situation:\n\n1. **Inspect the Tree**: Carefully examine the rest of the tree to assess the extent of the damage. Look for signs of new growth on the branches. If new leaves are not emerging, it may indicate that the buds did not survive the cold weather.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Remove any dead branches or shoots. This will help the tree focus its energy on healthy parts and prevent the spread of disease. Be sure to sterilize your pruning tools between cuts to prevent the spread of bacteria or fungi.\n\n3. **Fertilization**: Apply a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy new growth. Use a product that is suitable for fruit trees and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application rate and timing.\n\n4. **Watering**: Ensure the tree receives adequate water, especially if the soil is dry. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.\n\n5. **Mulching**: Add a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture and reduce soil temperature fluctuations. Avoid piling the mulch too close to the trunk as this can lead to rot.\n\n6. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the tree throughout the growing season. Look for signs of stress such as yellowing leaves, wilting, or new growth that appears pale or stunted. Adjust your management practices as needed based on these observations.\n\n7. **Pest and Disease Management**: Keep an eye out for pests and diseases that might take advantage of weakened trees. Monitor for signs of insects or fungal diseases and treat accordingly.\n\n8. **Supportive Practices**: Consider providing support to young trees or those that have suffered significant damage to help them maintain their structure as they recover.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help the peach tree recover and continue to produce well in the future. It's also advisable to consult with a local horticulturist or agricultural extension agent who can provide more specific advice based on local conditions and the tree's history.",

This is some sort of leaf spot disease caused by another type of fungi. It appears to be Cercospora or a similar fungi. </p> <p>There are many leaf spot diseases, and most are not life threatening. This late in the season the tree has stored nutrients in the roots for winter, and the leaf spots are a cosmetic issue. To reduce fungi overwintering, rake up all the leaves and discard this fall.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.uaex.uada.edu/yard-garden/plant-health-clinic/docs/2019_Plant_Health_Clinic_Newsletters/Plant%20Health%20Clinic%20Newsletter-Issue%2020.pdf\">https://www.uaex.uada.edu/yard-garden/plant-health-clinic/docs/2019_Plant_Health_Clinic_Newsletters/Plant%20Health%20Clinic%20Newsletter-Issue%2020.pdf</a></p> <p>See this article for how to apply fungicide sprays( always done in spring as leaves bud out) if you decide to spray the tree next spring: <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/anthracnose-and-other-common-leaf-diseases-of-deciduous-shade-trees.html\">https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/anthracnose-and-other-common-leaf-diseases-of-deciduous-shade-trees.html</a></p> <p>Fungicides for use in home gardens include products with the active ingredient mancozeb and chlorothalonil. Please follow all directions and precautions on any chemicals you use. If you are consuming the fruit, you must only use fungicides labeled for fruit trees, and follow the directions on the label.</p> <p>To keep the tree as healthy as possible:</p> <p>Deeply water the tree when we have hot dry weather with no rainfall for 10-14 days. </p> <p>Pull the mulch back from the base of the trunk so it does not touch the bark( reduces chances of rot)</p> <p>Avoid injuring any areas on trunk or branches. The wet wood started in an old wound. At this time there is nothing to be done for that wound, other than giving the tree good care each year.</p> <p>To reduce leaf spot diseases, if you are wetting the leaves with a lawn sprinkler either redirect the sprinkler, or water only early in the day so leaves dry out as quickly as possible in the sunlight.</p> <p>Improve air circulation around the tree and through the branches by properly pruning and thinning other trees and shrubs near it, and thinning the mulberry. </p> <p>If you prune the tree, use sharp, clean tools and prune correctly. Clean the pruning tool blades with 70% isopropyl alcohol, as recommended in the wetwood article above. Here is a guide on correct pruning of branches. Note figure 2 \u2013 and the section on how to correctly prune.</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/mg8\">https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/mg8</a><br /> </p> ",

The log lies horizontally across the slabs, and there are a few dried leaves scattered around, indicating an outdoor setting.

Similar to other branches on the tree which have experienced cicada damage, the top 18 inches is completely brown and dead-looking.  We planted the tree about five years ago.  It was probably 7 ft. tall when we planted it and is now about 15 ft. tall (not sure how old that makes the tree).  The tree was unfortunately too tall and wide to try to install cicada netting, but I am very worried about the loss of the leader branch.  The tree has a very upright growth habit (it's kind of shaped like a Christmas tree) and other than the leader, all the other branches spread outwards horizontally.  Will my tree grow a new leader?  What do I need to do to insure that my tree can continue to grow in a healthy manner?  Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAudra Ziegel",

You don't need to intervene, and while trimming off the broken branch tips would be recommended on a smaller sapling, in this case\u00a0it would be too impractical given the tree's size.</p><p>Miri</p>",

                "answer": "The image shows a black gum tree (Nyssa sylvatica) that appears to be healthy, with vibrant green leaves and no obvious signs of disease or structural issues. However, the tree's growth pattern suggests it might benefit from some management strategies to ensure its health and longevity.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Pruning:**\n   - **Reason:** The tree has a very upright growth habit with horizontal spreading branches. This type of growth can lead to an imbalance if not managed properly.\n   - **Strategy:** Regular pruning to maintain a balanced shape and to remove any dead, diseased, or crossing branches. This will help distribute sunlight evenly and improve air circulation, which can reduce the risk of disease.\n\n2. **Watering:**\n   - **Reason:** Black gum trees prefer well-draining soil but can tolerate a wide range of soil types. However, they require consistent moisture, especially during their early stages.\n   - **Strategy:** Ensure the tree is watered regularly, especially during dry spells. A drip irrigation system could be beneficial for maintaining consistent moisture levels.\n\n3. **Mulching:**\n   - **Reason:** Mulching helps retain soil moisture and reduces weed competition.\n   - **Strategy:** Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree, being careful not to cover the trunk, as this can lead to disease.\n\n4. **Fertilization:**\n   - **Reason:** The tree may benefit from a slow-release fertilizer to promote healthy growth.\n   - **Strategy:** Apply a balanced fertilizer in spring, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to avoid over-fertilization.\n\n5. **Monitor for Pests and Diseases:**\n   - **Reason:** Although the tree looks healthy in the image, it's important to monitor for pests and diseases that could develop over time.\n   - **Strategy:** Inspect the tree periodically for signs of pest infestations or diseases. If issues arise, consult with a local horticulturist or arborist for appropriate treatment.\n\n6. **Staking (if necessary):**\n   - **Reason:** If the tree is still young, staking might be needed to provide additional support.\n   - **Strategy:** Use soft ties and consider removing stakes once the tree has developed a strong trunk and branches.\n\nBy implementing these management strategies, you can help ensure that your black gum tree continues to thrive and grow healthily in its environment.",

With privet, they do have success with \"rejuvenation pruning\" which means cutting the entire plant down to the ground and the suckers will create a new shrub. Doing it at this time of year can be stressful, but it may be your best option.<br><br>Another thing to consider would be to prune out the dead areas of the shrub back to live tissue. This will be cumbersome and may result in shrubs that are not attractive.\u00a0<br><br>The smaller leaves are from stressors (temperature, drought/excess water, root system dysfunction, etc.). It's just a sign the shrub is under stress.\u00a0<br><br>The final option would be to remove the shrubs and replant. You can also wait and see if the shrubs continue to push growth through mid-June. But if you gently bend the twigs of areas that haven't leafed out and the twigs snap, it's a sign those tissues are dead.\u00a0",

The \ncaterpillars can be the brown or olive green color you observed or they \ncan be jet black. You can read more about them in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/r10/forest-grasslandhealth/?cid=FSEPRD593346&amp;width=full\">this writeup</a> from the US Forest Service.\n<br>\nThe\n green caterpillar you found is the larval stage of the western tiger \nswallowtail butterfly. The butterflies are the big yellow and black \nbutterflies we see in the summertime. You can see pictures of the adults\n and larvae <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://butterfliesofamerica.com/papilio_rutulus.htm\">here</a>.\n<br>\nBoth of the caterpillars you found are native to Alaska and are generally not considered pests.\n",

Unless your strawberry plans are \"everbearing\" or day-neutrals, you can clip the plants back when they are finished fruiting (probably close to if not now) and since you are gardening organically, the best way\u00a0 to get rid of the eggs is to clip the stem below the cluster , discard it into a plastic bag or glass jar, and\u00a0 add either water or vinegar and seal it up. This should destroy the pests (it might take a while) without the use of chemicals. Regular strawberries are normally clipped back after fruiting o allow the plant to rest and gear up for developing new foliage in the following season.

The presence of these eggs can lead to the infestation of the plant, which may result in leaf damage and reduced fruit yield if not managed properly.\n\nFor an organic garden in Jackson County, Oregon, the recommended management strategy for this issue could include the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep a close eye on the plants for signs of infestation. This will help you catch any issues early and allow you to take immediate action.\n\n2. **Physical Removal**: Manually remove any damaged leaves and dispose of them in a trash bag to prevent the spread of pests.\n\n3. **Beneficial Insects**: Introduce beneficial insects such as ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps that feed on the pests. These natural predators can help control the population without the use of chemicals.\n\n4. **Incorporate Companion Plants**: Plant companion plants like marigolds, which have been known to repel certain pests, around your strawberry plants.\n\n5. **Use Neem Oil**: Apply neem oil, a natural insecticide, to the plants. Neem oil is derived from the seeds of the neem tree and is effective against many pests, including those that lay eggs on leaves.\n\n6. **Covering**: Use floating row covers to protect the plants from adult pests. These covers allow sunlight and air to pass through but can help reduce the number of pests reaching the plants.\n\n7. **Healthy Soil**: Maintain healthy soil by adding compost and ensuring good drainage. Healthy plants are better able to resist pests and diseases.\n\n8. **Avoid Overwatering**: Ensure that the plants do not get overly wet, as moist conditions can attract pests and promote their breeding.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage the issue without resorting to chemical pesticides, which aligns with organic gardening practices.",

The plant has multiple stems and leaves, with the leaves being green and somewhat broad. Some of the leaves appear to have minor blemishes or spots, possibly indicating signs of disease or damage. The stems are brownish-green and show some wear, such as slight discoloration and possibly some insect activity or environmental stress.\n\nThe mulch around the plant consists of small, shredded pieces of wood, which is commonly used for garden beds to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil quality. The ground beneath the mulch appears to be compacted soil, suggesting that the plant may not be deeply rooted at this stage.\n\nThe time stamp indicates the photo was taken on June 25, 2021, at 00:30:18, which seems unusual as it suggests the image was captured at midnight. This could be an error in the timestamp or a specific context where the image was taken during nighttime.",

                "response": "<p>The leaves in your photo look like scorch, however, the\nplant more closely resembles Aegopodium\npodagraria (commonly called snow on the mountain, bishop's weed or\ngoutweed) than Lamium maculatum\n(commonly called Lamium or Dead Nettle). Provided is information on both, in which\ngrowing conditions are similar.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Aegopodium podagraria\ndoes not do well in sun, dry conditions or hot windy weather and can generally\nlook unsightly in the heat of the summer (July &amp; August). CSU recommends\nfor Aegopodium podagraria to look its\nbest, the deeper the shade the better, and to maintain consistently moister\nsoil conditions. Getting more sun exposure or less moisture than necessary\nresults in tip and marginal leaf scorch, dieback, stunted growth, and sometimes\nleaf drop, which is what appears to be happening.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Lamium maculatum\nalso does best in deeper shade with moister soil conditions. It dislikes high\nheat or humidity, and does best when soils are cool. Lamium struggles to grow\nwell in compacted or poorly drained soils. Unsightly bare patches (often called\nmelting out) may appear in the heat of the summer, particularly in heat or\nhumidity. Leaf scorch may also occur, especially if soils are allowed to dry\nout or if plants are grown in too much sun. </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Two other issues to consider are: </p>\n\n<p>1) Pay attention to moisture conditions. Plants under trees\nand around shrubs and other plants compete for water, so sometimes it is\nnecessary to provide additional supplemental water where competition is high. </p>\n\n<p>2) The rocks may be a contributing factor to excess heat and\ndry conditions. If this area gets several hours of sun in the afternoon \u2014\nwhich is the hottest part of the day \u2014 the rocks also raise the temperature\nof the surrounding area. It appears that a lot of the dieback is in and around these rocks.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Below are some links about scorch. Although this information\npertains to trees and shrubs, it is also pertinent for groundcovers and many\nperennials. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/weeds-cultural-problems/2133-leaf-scorch-trees-shrubs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/weeds-cultural-problems/2133-leaf-scorch-trees-shrubs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/leaf-scorch-2-911/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/leaf-scorch-2-911/</a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Attached are two photos.

The plant seems healthy with no signs of damage such as holes, discoloration, or wilting that would typically indicate an infestation. The surrounding soil and rocks do not show signs of disturbance or presence of grubs or bugs.\n\nHowever, since the plant is growing in a natural environment, it's possible that some unseen pests could be present without being immediately visible. If you're concerned about potential issues, here are some general management strategies:\n\n1. **Regular Inspection**: Continuously check the plant and its surroundings for any signs of pests or diseases.\n2. **Soil Health**: Ensure the soil around the plant is well-drained but not compacted. This can help prevent soil-borne pathogens from harming the plant.\n3. **Mulching**: Use mulch to protect the base of the plant and improve the soil's moisture retention and temperature regulation.\n4. **Drought Tolerance**: Black-eyed Susans are generally drought-tolerant, so ensure they get enough water during dry spells, but avoid overwatering which can lead to root rot.\n5. **Biological Control**: If you suspect a specific pest problem, consider using biological controls such as beneficial insects or nematodes that can help manage pests naturally.\n6. **Cultural Practices**: Maintain good cultural practices, such as removing dead leaves and spent flowers to prevent the spread of disease.\n7. **Consultation**: If you notice any unusual symptoms or if the plant starts to decline despite your care, consult with a local horticulturist or extension service for further guidance.\n\nSince no bugs or grubs were found in the dirt surrounding the plant, the immediate concern appears to be minimal, but ongoing monitoring is always a good practice to ensure the health of the plant.",

                "answer": "The plant in the image appears to be pearlwort (Sagina subulata), which is indeed a common invader in poorly drained areas, as mentioned in the background information. Pearlwort can quickly spread and dominate ground cover, making it difficult to control manually.\n\nGiven the context of the location and time provided, here are some recommended management strategies for controlling pearlwort:\n\n### 1. **Chemical Control**\n   - **Herbicides**: Use selective herbicides that target broadleaf weeds like pearlwort without harming grasses or other desirable plants. Commonly used products include 2,4-D or triclopyr. It's important to follow the application guidelines carefully, especially when applying near trees or other sensitive plants.\n   - **Preventative Measures**: Apply these herbicides before the pearlwort seedlings emerge in early spring (April/May) to prevent their establishment. Repeat applications may be necessary depending on the severity of infestation.\n\n### 2. **Physical Control**\n   - **Manual Removal**: While challenging due to its rapid spread, regular hand-pulling can be effective if done promptly. Be sure to remove the entire root system to prevent re-growth.\n   - **Mulching**: Applying a thick layer of organic mulch (like wood chips or straw) can smother the pearlwort and other weeds. Ensure the mulch covers the soil completely and is reapplied annually as it breaks down.\n\n### 3. **Mechanical Control**\n   - **Tillage**: Light cultivation with a cultivator can help disrupt the pearlwort roots, although this method is labor-intensive and may require repeated applications.\n   - **Trimmers and Edgers**: Using electric trimmers or edging tools can effectively remove the surface growth of pearlwort, but this method also requires regular maintenance.\n\n### 4. **Cultural Control**\n   - **Improving Drainage**: Ensuring proper drainage in the area can reduce the likelihood of pearlwort infestation. This might involve adding compost or improving the soil structure.\n   - **Healthy Grass Cover**: Maintaining a dense layer of healthy grass can outcompete pearlwort. Regular mowing and fertilization can help establish a strong grass cover.\n\n### 5. **Biological Control**\n   - **Natural Predators**: While there are no known natural predators of pearlwort, introducing species that feed on it could potentially help control its spread. However, this approach is still experimental and not widely used.\n\n### 6. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**",

                "answer": "The image shows some stems of a peony plant that appear to have brown or dead spots on their bark, which could be indicative of various issues such as disease, pests, or environmental stress. Here are some steps you might consider to address the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**: \n   - **Disease**: Look for signs of specific diseases like canker (caused by fungi) or powdery mildew. Cankers may appear as dark, sunken areas on the stem that can eventually girdle the stem, leading to death. Powdery mildew typically presents as a white, powdery growth on leaves and stems.\n   - **Pests**: Check if there are insects like aphids or scale insects present, which can cause discoloration and dieback.\n   - **Environmental Stress**: Extreme weather conditions, such as drought or excessive rain, can also cause browning of the stems.\n\n2. **Pruning**:\n   - If the issue appears to be localized (e.g., just a few stems), consider pruning out the affected parts to prevent the disease from spreading further.\n   - Use clean, sharp pruners and disinfect them with rubbing alcohol between cuts to avoid introducing new pathogens.\n\n3. **Fertilization and Watering**:\n   - Ensure the soil around the peony is not overly wet or dry. Peonies prefer moist but well-drained soil.\n   - Fertilize sparingly during the growing season. Avoid fertilizing too much or too close to the stem as this can lead to burn.\n\n4. **Disease Management**:\n   - Apply a fungicide if you suspect fungal infection. Choose a product labeled for use on peonies and follow the instructions carefully.\n   - Keep the garden area well-maintained; remove and dispose of dead plant material to reduce the chances of disease spread.\n\n5. **Check the Buds**:\n   - Since the more mature buds seem to be developing okay, it\u2019s important to focus on the health of the rest of the plant. Continue to monitor the affected stems and other parts of the plant for signs of improvement or worsening.\n\n6. **Consult an Expert**:\n   - If the issue persists or worsens, consult with a local horticulturist or a certified pest management professional who can provide more specific advice based on your location and climate.\n\nBy addressing these potential causes and implementing appropriate management strategies, you should be able to help the peony recover and maintain its health.",

If you want apples that are free of insect damage you need to follow a spray program or find ways to exclude the bugs. Apple maggots are active most of the summer. <br /></p> <p>The issue with using sprays is that you need to apply after every rain (which wasn't really an issue this year!). The easiest organic way to keep bugs out of apples is by bagging them early in their development.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a guide to dealing with apple maggot, including bagging the fruit:</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/apple-maggot\">https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/apple-maggot</a><br /><br />I have a Honeycrisp and for many years have bagged apples. It\u2019s a time investment when you\u2019re slipping baggies on small fruit in June, but it\u2019s worth it because you don\u2019t have to repeatedly spray. A guide to bagging is included in the above link.</p> <p>Some advice if you choose to bag fruit: timing is critical. You need to bag when the apples are about the size of a grape. And stapling the baggie on either side of the fruit stem is a good way to ensure that the bags don\u2019t blow off. Just pressing the bags shut doesn\u2019t work that well.</p> <p>Some people use these imperfect apples in pies or cider.</p> <p>Hope this helps. Good luck.</p>",

They were limited to one room in our walkout lower level.  Now I just found 2 dead wasps in an upstairs bedroom behind a couch that is in front of a window.  I assume they are from this summer but very surprised that they were upstairs.  Attached is an image of the front and back of what I just found.  I would like to know what type of wasp this is.

Given the location in Brazoria County, Texas, with heavy clay soil and hot weather, some common challenges for boxwoods include:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Clay soils retain water longer, leading to root rot if the plant is not allowed to dry out properly between waterings.\n2. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Boxwoods can suffer from iron deficiency, which might cause yellowing of the leaves with green veins (chlorosis).\n3. **Salt Accumulation**: If the soil is heavily amended with fertilizers, salt buildup can occur, leading to leaf discoloration.\n4. **Pest Infestations**: Boxwood adelgid is a common pest that can cause discoloration and leaf drop.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n1. **Inspect Soil Moisture**: Ensure the soil is not overly wet. Check the depth of the water penetration; if the soil stays wet for more than two weeks, consider increasing the interval between watering.\n2. **Check for Salt Buildup**: Apply chelated iron or elemental sulfur to address any nutrient deficiencies. For salt buildup, leach the soil with water until clear, then apply an appropriate fertilizer.\n3. **Monitor for Pests**: Look for signs of adelgids or other pests by closely inspecting the undersides of leaves. Treat with an insecticide if necessary.\n4. **Adjust Fertilization Practices**: Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer suitable for boxwoods. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially in clay-rich soils.\n5. **Prune and Shape**: Prune dead or damaged foliage to promote new growth and maintain healthy appearance.\n\nIf the issue persists despite these measures, consider consulting a local horticulturist or agricultural extension service for further assistance tailored to your specific conditions.",

I've sprayed it with a fungicide for fruit trees but in late spring/ early summer it always comes back. It drops its leaves, the leaves have spots and the turn yellow\r\nI'd like to know what other steps I can take to prevent this from happening year after year. I'd also would like to know if pruning the tree at this time of year is okay to do. Would getting more air circulation help it? I certainly don't want to stress it out. Please help!!",

Avoid overhead watering.\u00a0<br /> 3. Plant resistant cultivars where possible but this doesn't help with an existing tree.\u00a0<br /> 4. Registered fungicides can be applied preventatively at <span style=\"color:rgb(192, 80, 77)\">2-week intervals beginning at budbreak until after petal fall.</span><br /> <br /> Pruning should be done in dormant times; winter to very early spring.\u00a0 \u00a0<br /> <br /> Also make sure your tree does not have burnt looking branches that indicate fire blight.\u00a0 When pruning a fire blight tree always go back\u00a06-12\u201d of healthy tissue and\u00a0remove along with cankered area or to point of attachment.

An old fashioned, persistent bulb that blooms once temperatures cool a little and late summer rains arrive.  Blooms appear first, followed by long strap-like foliage.  Allow the foliage to mature and when yellow, it can be cut.  This process allows the bulb to be \"energized - nourished\" for next year's bloom.  The best time to relocate them, is when the foliage yellows in spring.

It is a common fungus among squash and cucumber plants. If you noticed it first on your pumpkin plant, it likely infected your lilac bush. If you want a definitive diagnosis, please bring in or mail a sample. <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/how-to-submit-samples-to-a-csu-extension-plant-diagnostic-clinic-7/\">Here are instructions</a>.\u00a0 You can also drop off a sample at the Boulder County Extension Office at 9595 Nelson Rd, Longmont.\u00a0\u00a0303-678-6238<br /> Main points:<ul><li>For the pumpkins, remove the infected leaves and throw in the trash. Do not compost.\u00a0</li><li>Since your lilac has such a widespread infection, treating with a fungicide as outlined in the resources below and intense pruning are advised.</li><li>Make sure you are not overwatering the area and there is sufficient air space at the base and around\u00a0the plants.</li></ul> Here are a couple of resources for <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/powdery-mildews-2-902/\">Powdery Mildew on lilacs</a> and <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/cucumbers-pumpkins-squash-and-melons-7-609/\">Cucumbers, Pumpkins and Squash</a>.<br /> <br /> Your lilac bush could use some pruning to let more air circulate throughout. While it is best to prune lilac stems right after blooms fade (blooms appear on old wood), your shrub may benefit from a <a href=\"https://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/trees-shrubs-vines/1729-renewing-shrubs/\">Rejuvenation Pruning now and Annual Pruning</a> going forward.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Best,<br /> <br /> CSU Extension Boulder County Master Gardeners<br /> <p><em><strong>Please take a moment to complete the following confidential survey in order to ensure our continued ability to serve the public.</strong></em> </p> <p><a href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1BdCCXDXkAf4GOPwu6diOA?domain=surveymonkey.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"0\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HorticultureREGDATA</a></p> <p><em>New: Boulder County has a new website: </em>[BoulderCounty.gov]<em>BoulderCounty.gov</em><em>!

                "response": "<p>Hello, and thank you for contacting Ask Extension about your bay laurel tree.</p><p>t appears your tree has a scale insect. These small insects protect themselves under a wax coating while they feed.\u00a0Some of these sucking insects can transmit plant diseases. Scale is a difficult pest to control and there are many types of scale. Not all\u00a0controls work on all species. I have compiled some information on controls for scale.\u00a0</p><p>Scale insects remove sugar-rich fluids from plants and eliminate a sticky material, called honeydew. The black\u00a0fungus on the leaves is\u00a0called sooty mold\u00a0that grows on the\u00a0honeydew. This mold decreases the aesthetic value of plants and stresses them further by blocking the sunlight needed for photosynthesis.\u00a0</p>FOLIAGE SPRAY <p>Horticultural oil is effective in spring or summer on broadleaf evergreens when sprayed soon after most crawlers have emerged and most scales are in the young nymph stage. Thoroughly cover with spray the plant parts where scales occur, typically on twig terminals and the underside of leaves.</p><p>With all insecticides, be sure to completely read and follow the product label instructions for safe and effective use. Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water, poisoning natural enemies and pollinators, and causing secondary pest outbreaks.\u00a0</p><p>Complete spray coverage of infested plant parts with horticultural oil at the proper time provides good control of most scales. Horticultural oils (e.g., Bonide Horticultural Oil and Monterey Horticultural Oil) are specially refined petroleum products, often called narrow-range, superior, or supreme oils. Other nonpersistent, contact sprays for garden and landscape plants include insecticidal soap (Safer Brand Insect Killing Soap Concentrate II), neem oil (Bayer Advanced Natria Neem Oil Concentrate, Green Light Neem, Garden Safe Brand Neem).</p><p>These insecticides have low toxicity to people and pets and relatively little adverse impact on the populations of pollinators and natural enemies and the benefits they provide. To obtain adequate control, thoroughly wet the infested plant parts with spray, typically shoot terminals and the underside of leaves. More than one application per growing season may be needed, especially if the targeted pest has more than one generation a year. </p>Dormant Season (Winter treatment) <p>To control most scales overwintering on deciduous woody plants, thoroughly spray the bark of terminal shoots with oil during winter. For oak pit scales, sycamore scale, and other harder to control species, spray during the plant\u2019s delayed-dormant period, which is after the buds swell but before buds open. <br /></p> Precautions on Using Oils <p>Follow product labels, which may say to not spray certain plant species or mix oil with certain other products. Do not apply oil or other insecticides when it is foggy, freezing (under 32\u00b0F), hot (over 90\u00b0F), when relative humidity is above 90%, or if rain is expected in the next 24 hours. Especially at locations with hot weather, be sure plants are well irrigated before spraying foliage.</p>SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDES<p>These products may be\u00a0for licensed professional applicators only.\u00a0Neonicotinoids vary in effectiveness for scale control. Some are effective on one type of scale but not another, so positive identification of the species of scale insect is necessary. Systemics can translocate into flowers and have adverse effects on natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen.\u00a0</p><p>I hope this information is useful. If you have any other questions, please write again.</p>",

Given the species mentioned as \"hog peanut\" and the location and time provided, it's important to note that hog peanut (Amphicarpaea bracteata) is not typically plagued by major pest issues like those mentioned in the background information, such as aphids, mites, or leafhoppers. However, the specific mention of \"tall garden phlox\" suggests that the issue might be more related to phlox rather than hog peanut.\n\nFor hog peanut, common pests include aphids, which can cause leaf distortion and stunted growth. If this is indeed hog peanut,\u7ba1\u7406 strategies would typically involve:\n\n1. **Observation**: Regularly inspect the plant for signs of pest or disease.\n2. **Cultural Practices**: Ensure the plant is growing in well-draining soil with adequate sunlight and water. Avoid overwatering, as soggy conditions can promote fungal diseases.\n3. **Natural Controls**: Introduce beneficial insects such as ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps to control aphid populations.\n4. **Chemical Control**: If necessary, use organic insecticides or fungicides labeled for use on legumes, ensuring they are safe for the environment and the plant itself.\n5. **Physical Removal**: Manually remove affected leaves and stems to prevent the spread of pests or diseases.\n\nIf the issue is related to another plant, such as phlox, consult a local extension service or horticulturist for specific management recommendations tailored to that plant species.",

Given the time of year (June) and location (Baltimore County, Maryland), it's important to consider the typical pests and diseases that affect holly during this period.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n1. **Holly Leaf Miner (Aculops hollae)** - This is a common pest that can cause leaf damage by mining into the leaves.\n2. **Fungal Diseases** - Such as powdery mildew or rust, which can cause spots on the leaves.\n3. **Insects** - Aphids, mites, or other small insects could also be causing the damage.\n\n### Management Strategies:\n1. **Inspect the Plant Thoroughly**: Look closely at the leaves for signs of insect infestation or fungal growth.\n2. **Identify the Cause**:\n   - **Leaf Miner**: Look for small, white, serpentine mines in the leaves. Treatment involves horticultural oils or insecticidal soap.\n   - **Fungal Diseases**: Look for powdery white spots or brown lesions on the leaves. Fungal diseases might require fungicides like neem oil or sulfur-based sprays.\n   - **Insect Infestations**: Identify the specific insects and choose appropriate pesticides if necessary. For example, aphids can be controlled with insecticidal soaps or neem oil.\n3. **Prune Affected Leaves**: Remove and destroy any leaves that show significant damage to prevent spread.\n4. **Promote Plant Health**: Ensure the plant is receiving adequate water, sunlight, and nutrients. Good soil health and mulching can help the plant resist pests and diseases.\n5. **Monitor for Recurrence**: Regularly inspect the plant for signs of recurrence and treat as needed.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n- **Apply Horticultural Oil or Insecticidal Soap**: If leaf miner activity is suspected, apply a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the affected areas.\n- **Fungicide Application**: If fungal diseases are evident, use a fungicide such as neem oil or sulfur.\n- **General Care**: Ensure the holly is well-watered and fertilized appropriately for its needs.\n\nBy identifying and addressing the specific issue present, you can manage the problem effectively and maintain the health of your holly plant.",

        "question": "My lawn has hundreds/thousands of little tree seedlings. The lawn is actually quite lush, but these seedlings have taken over. I think they are elm trees. They are not suckers from roots. When I pull them up (and I can pull 20 in a clump) they have thin, white roots that come up easily. There are far too many for me to pull, however. It would take me all summer and more. I had a lawn service, and they told me they didn't know what to do, so I canned them. I contacted LiquiLawn, and they sent me a bookmark with PlantTalk's info on it and suggested I contact you. Any suggestions, aside from killing the lawn and re-sodding?<br>",

Given the background information, these seedlings appear to be an invasive species, possibly an unwanted plant that is competing with the desired grass for resources. Here are some recommended management strategies for dealing with this situation:\n\n1. **Chemical Control**: Consider using selective herbicides designed to target broadleaf weeds. These products can be applied directly to the seedlings while being careful not to damage the surrounding grass. Always read and follow the label instructions carefully.\n\n2. **Physical Removal**: While manual removal isn't feasible due to the large number of seedlings, physical methods like mulching can help suppress their growth. Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (like wood chips or straw) around the base of the seedlings to smother them. This method is less effective on larger seedlings but can be used as a preventive measure.\n\n3. **Cultural Controls**: Ensure the lawn is healthy and well-maintained. A strong, dense lawn can outcompete the seedlings by using more water, nutrients, and sunlight. Regular mowing at the appropriate height and fertilizing when necessary can help the lawn stay competitive.\n\n4. **Biological Controls**: If applicable, introduce natural predators or diseases that affect the seedlings but do not harm the desired grasses. This approach requires research and may not always be feasible or effective.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures**: Planting a more competitive grass variety, such as one that is better adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, can prevent new invasions. Additionally, maintaining consistent and appropriate watering and fertilization practices can help the existing grass remain dominant.\n\nGiven that the seedlings are taking over the lawn, a combination of chemical control and cultural practices might be the most effective short-term solution. Always consult with a local extension agent or a professional landscaper for specific recommendations tailored to your location and the particular species of seedlings present.",

                "answer": "The image shows an elm tree with leaves that have signs of leaf spot, which is a common disease affecting elm trees. This condition can be caused by various fungal pathogens and typically manifests as spots on the leaves, which can eventually lead to leaf discoloration and premature defoliation.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Fungicide Application**: Consider applying fungicides that are effective against the specific fungus causing the leaf spot. It's important to choose a fungicide that is registered for use on elms and that is labeled for the disease you're treating. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Remove any affected or dead branches. This helps to reduce the spread of the disease and allows fresh air to circulate, which can help prevent the disease from spreading further.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Maintain good cultural practices such as proper watering and fertilization. Overwatering can increase the risk of fungal diseases, so ensure that the soil around the tree is well-drained. Avoid overhead watering, as this can promote fungal growth.\n\n4. **Healthy Tree Care**: Ensure the overall health of the tree by providing adequate nutrients, water, and sunlight. A healthy tree is better able to fight off diseases.\n\n5. **Biological Control**: Sometimes using beneficial fungi or bacteria that can suppress the pathogen can be an option. However, this approach is more complex and should be done under professional guidance.\n\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the tree for signs of new infections. Early detection and treatment can be crucial in managing the disease effectively.\n\n7. **Consultation**: If the disease persists despite your efforts, it might be advisable to consult a local horticulturist or arborist who can provide tailored advice based on the specific conditions of the tree and the local environment.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help manage the leaf spot issue and potentially slow down the progression of the disease on the elm tree.",

                "answer": "Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) is an invasive species that can dominate disturbed areas and outcompete native plants, often causing significant ecological damage. The image you provided shows Japanese stiltgrass with some green leaves but also includes dried and dead stems, indicating that it may be in the process of being managed or that it's growing under stressful conditions.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for controlling Japanese stiltgrass:\n\n1. **Mechanical Control**: \n   - **Hand Pulling**: This is effective for small infestations. Carefully remove the plant by pulling it out at the base to avoid spreading the rhizomes.\n   - **Mowing**: Frequent mowing can help reduce the spread of Japanese stiltgrass. However, it is not a permanent solution as the plant can regrow from its rhizomes.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Herbicides**: Products such as glyphosate (Roundup) or triclopyr (e.g., Trimec Herbicide) can be applied directly to the foliage of the plant. It is important to follow label instructions carefully to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n   - **Pre-emergence Herbicides**: For new seedlings, pre-emergence herbicides like pendimethalin (Pendulum) or imazapyr (Plateau) can be used to prevent germination.\n\n3. **Biological Control**:\n   - There are no widespread biological controls for Japanese stiltgrass, but some insects have been studied for their potential to control it. However, these methods are still experimental and not widely available.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Soil Management**: Improving soil health and fertility can make it harder for Japanese stiltgrass to establish itself. Adding organic matter can enhance soil structure and nutrient availability.\n   - **Water Management**: Avoid overwatering, as Japanese stiltgrass thrives in moist conditions. Proper irrigation practices can help suppress its growth.\n\n5. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Combine multiple control methods to address different life stages of the plant and minimize the development of resistance. For example, use mechanical methods initially followed by chemical treatments if necessary.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Prevention**:\n   - Regularly monitor the area for Japanese stiltgrass and other invasive species. Early detection and intervention can prevent larger infestations.\n\nIn the context of Montgomery County, Maryland, where you have observed Japanese stiltgrass, it would",

But since about a month we have noticed the leaves are browning and and feel very dry, it is mainly on the lower leaves and one side and the underneath. The plant doesn't seem to be dropping leaves. We are concerned it is dying. Can you advise if the plant is ill and if so what can we do to help it. Any advise is appreciated! \n\nThank You,\nBrittany ",

Given the context provided, it seems the problem might be related to insect activity, particularly codling moth (Cydia pomonella) or similar pests, which can cause damage to the fruit's skin.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Insecticide Application**:\n   - **Codling Moth Control**: Apply an appropriate insecticide targeting codling moths. Timing is crucial; treatment should be applied during the larval stages before they cause significant damage. Common insecticides include spinosad, pyrethroids, or synthetic pyrethroids like lambda-cyhalothrin.\n   - **Timing**: Treatments should start around petal fall and continue through the end of the growing season.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Sanitation**: Remove and destroy affected fruit to reduce the overwintering population of larvae.\n   - **Pruning**: Properly prune trees to improve air circulation and reduce the microclimate that can favor pest development.\n\n3. **Biological Control**:\n   - **Encourage Beneficial Insects**: Certain beneficial insects like lady beetles and lacewings can help control pests naturally.\n   - **Release Predatory Mites**: Some predatory mites feed on eggs and larvae of pests, helping to control populations.\n\n4. **Resistance Management**:\n   - **Rotating Insecticides**: Use different insecticides from various chemical classes to avoid resistance development in pests.\n   - **Crop Rotation**: Rotate crops to disrupt pest life cycles and reduce the buildup of pest populations.\n\n5. **Monitoring**:\n   - Regularly inspect the orchard for signs of insect activity or damaged fruit.\n   - Consider using traps to monitor the presence and activity levels of codling moths.\n\n6. **Alternative Management**:\n   - **Cultivar Selection**: Plant resistant varieties if possible.\n   - **Cultural Practices**: Maintain good orchard hygiene and sanitation practices.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Consult Local Extension Services**: For specific recommendations tailored to the local environment and pest pressures.\n- **Monitor Weather Conditions**: Pest activity can be influenced by temperature and humidity, so keep an eye on weather patterns that may affect pest development.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can manage the insect damage effectively and maintain the health of your apple trees and fruit.",

                "response": "Thank you for your question.<br><br>It looks and sounds like your Fireside apple tree has fire blight, a potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora. It affects plants in the Rose family, most specifically apples, crab apples, and mountain ash. Fireside is a susceptible apple variety. Fortunately Haralson is a resistant variety. Note that \"resistant\" does not mean it may not display some symptoms of fire blight, just that it has been bred to be able to tolerate some level of the disease.<br><br>Details about fire blight can be found in this publication: <a href=\"http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/fruit/apple-pest-management/fire-blight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Fire Blight</a>.<br><br>This year has been hard on trees \u2013 a drougthy fall, harsh winter, and wet spring - and bacteria present in seemingly unaffected leaf litter can enter through wounds in the tree as well as new growth which can be easily damaged by wind, hail, and insects. Bacteria also enter the tree through the blossoms, turning them black and \"scorched.\" Branches will ooze from the cankers, and the infected inner wood of the tree has a reddish discoloration. Shoots will turn black, wilt/shrivel, and bend into a \"shepherd's crook.\" You can see pictures of these symptoms in the above publication. <br><br>If your Fireside has not leafed out by now and is displaying one or more of these symptoms, then I would recommend removing the tree. If you choose to plant a new apple tree, select a variety \u2013 different than Haralson for best cross-pollination results \u2013 that is resistant to fire blight. <br><br>Best of luck to you and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

        "question": "I have an oak tree in my yard that was diagnosed last summer with kermes scale infestation. A tree service treated it in October (roughly 9 months ago) with a ground soak of some kind, possibly imidacloprid, and they said it should be treated 2 years in a row. They also did a fertilizer treatment.<br><br>At the end of May, I noticed lots of little white scale-like things on the trunk and surrounding the tree in the mulch and on rocks and on the nearby fence. I have read that these might be the cocooned males of the Kermes scale. I sprayed them with insecticidal soap, twice, about a week apart. I don't know whether this treatment will have any effect on them at this life stage, but I needed to try something.\u00a0<br><br>What is most distressing is that the tree is losing a lot of new growth. Chunks of leaves, anywhere from a few inches to more than a foot long, break off when the wind blows. Even a fairly moderate wind breaks them. This started happening last summer, but it is even worse this year. I have collected 3 yard waste bags full of broken-off leaves already this season. The tree is starting to look thin, and some branches, 2-3 inches in diameter, have died.\u00a0<br><br>I want to know what I should do to help this tree and keep it.\u00a0I certainly can follow-up with the second year of treatment. <br><br>My concern is that the tree seems even worse off this year than last year, despite treatment. Is there something more I could be doing? What's the prognosis for this tree?",

                "response": "<p>This appears to be <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-psyllid-insects-shrubs\">Boxwood Psyllid</a>, a common insect pest of boxwoods though generally not one that causes serious long-term damage to the plants. The leaves also show damage (perhaps from prior years) of Boxwood Mite, another typical pest for this shrub. Boxwoods are unfortunately vulnerable to <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-identify-and-manage-common-problems\">several pests and diseases</a> (though few plants are pest-free, to be fair); the linked page presents these symptoms and discusses management options (when treatments are practical). For psyllid, a strong spray of water from a hose will dislodge most of the insects; since they are still juveniles now, they cannot fly, though some might be able to crawl back onto the foliage. Similarly, periodic sprays with a forceful stream of plain water will also reduce mite numbers, though nothing can heal the damage to leaves already present. In time, evergreen shrubs shed damaged foliage along with a handful of older leaves, a normal process that occurs each year despite being considered evergreen overall.</p> <p>There could also be some\u00a0old <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-leafminer-shrubs\">leaf miner damage</a>, and maybe also some winter burn. The management directions on the link provided are pretty straight forward. You can try to prune the infected and damaged leaves out and that should drastically help reduce the population. If you start to see signs of new leaf damage (the mines from the worms) in late June you can treat with a systemic insecticide, just be cautious and read label directions as certain ones can be more harmful for beneficial pollinators.</p> <p>A fungal <em>Volutella</em> infection is common as well\u00a0as dieback from root decline (such as from overwatering or recurring drought stress) or vole damage around the base of the main stems (especially if heavily mulched).<br /><br />There are disease-resistant boxwood cultivars on the market these days (though they are in the minority), but none are immune to these or other ailments common to boxwoods. Worst-case, if the management of recurring outbreaks of these pests or a disease is too tedious or expensive, consider replacing the shrubs with a different species. Better yet, hedges or other mass plantings or plant groupings are best planted with a variety of species instead of a single species, which makes the planting more resilient in the face of potential problems since not all of the species in the planting will have equal vulnerability to the same issue. Always try to select a species that fits the site space availability well since, even though some shrubs are quite tolerant of pruning, they will be healthier and lower-maintenance overall if allowed to mature to their natural size (or close to it). Fortunately, many shrubs have dwarf cultivars available since small-maturing plants are currently popular.<br /></p> <p>You can prune out and remove any of the branches with brown or dying leaves as well. That will help improve air flow to the plants and push out new growth to cover the damage. </p> <p>Emily</p><figure><iframe style=\"width:500px;height:281px\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3i8mcoKapeY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure>",

From the picture,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/grape-insect-pests-of-the-home-garden/#GrapeFleaBeetle\"> grape flea beetles</a> appear to be the main pest; however, there could be other issues. According to our grape team, treatment for flea beetles include insecticidal soaps, copper/sulfate and Bordeaux mix are good options for managing 4 vines \"organically\". Note they also added that these beetles are tricky because they like to feed early and then you\n see the damage along that whole shoot as it emerges.

Since the mason bees holes were all sealed by this time, I covered the nests with a light sheet so the wasp couldn't get to mud sealed holes.  This spring I have had two mason bees covered with something, they couldn't fly and soon died.  Do you think this small wasp was a parasitic wasp and it had laid eggs on these mason bee larvae last Spring?  I have been keeping a close watch and all the other mason bees seem to be doing fine.

If you take a hand lens or magnifying glass you should be able to make out that these little creatures are pollen mites. The mites eat the pollen, but then hitch a ride to find new hosts on emerging bees. When loads are excessive the bee has trouble flying. Mites are controlled in the fall by washing the cocoons in a bleach solution. The technique is covered in the OSU Extension publication linked below. But you can also learn how to clean cocoons of mites by attending an OSU Master Gardener mason bee training in the fall. <br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9130\">https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9130</a><br>",

                "answer": "The image shows what appears to be a mason bee that has been covered in some substance, possibly pollen or another organic material, and it seems to have died. Given the background information provided, there are several potential issues that could lead to the death of mason bees:\n\n1. **Predation by Wasps**: The presence of a wasp near the mason bee holes suggests that wasps may be targeting mason bee nests. This could explain why some mason bees were found covered and dead.\n\n2. **Sealing of Holes**: If the mason bee holes were sealed prematurely, it could have prevented the mason bees from exiting their nests, leading to suffocation or starvation. This might also explain the deaths of some bees.\n\nTo address these issues, consider the following management strategies:\n\n### Preventing Predation by Wasps\n1. **Install Mesh Covers**: Place mesh covers over the mason bee nesting sites to prevent wasps from accessing the nests. This can be done by using fine mesh netting, such as hardware cloth, which will allow mason bees to enter but block larger insects like wasps.\n   \n2. **Attract Predators of Wasps**: Consider introducing natural predators of wasps, such as parasitic wasps (if they do not pose a threat to the mason bees) or certain types of spiders. However, ensure these predators are compatible with your local ecosystem to avoid unintended consequences.\n\n### Addressing Premature Nest Sealing\n1. **Monitor Nesting Sites Regularly**: Check the nesting sites more frequently to ensure that the holes remain open until the mason bees are ready to emerge. This can help prevent premature sealing of the nests.\n\n2. **Create Alternative Entry Points**: If you are managing a large number of mason bee nests, consider creating alternative entry points in the form of additional nesting sites. This can distribute the burden and reduce the likelihood of predation or accidental sealing of nests.\n\n3. **Use Natural Materials**: Ensure that the materials used for constructing the nesting sites are not too hard or too brittle, as these can sometimes lead to premature sealing.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help protect the mason bees and prevent further deaths due to predation and improper nest management.",

Perhaps a weed killer such as 2,4-D was used in a nearby\nlawn or field; the material easily drifts on the slightest breeze.\u00a0 Further, one form of 2,4-D is known to volatilize\nduring the heat waves such as we\u2019ve had recently.\n<br>2. Your compost is contaminated by a long-lasting herbicide,\nperhaps clopyralid or aminopyralid, an active ingredient used by farmers to\neliminate weeds from their whet and/or pastures. \u00a0You\u2019ll find a thorough description of the\ndamage, images of affected plants, and what to do next here: <a href=\"http://puyallup.wsu.edu/soilmgmt/Clopyralid.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://puyallup.wsu.edu/soilmgmt/Clopyralid.html</a>\n(Washington State University).\n\n\u00a0\n<br><br>If you\u2019re certain no herbicide has been used on your\nproperty or nearby, carry out this easy-to-do bio-assay to test your soil for\nherbicide contamination.\u00a0 If it turns out\npositive, do a bio-assay on any manure compost you obtain in the future.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http://puyallup.wsu.edu/soilmgmt/pubs/clobioassay.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://puyallup.wsu.edu/soilmgmt/pubs/clobioassay.pdf</a>\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n<br><br>Good luck,\n\n<br>Jean<br><br><br><br>",

Given that the grapevines are growing rapidly and the issue is exacerbated by rain, it suggests that the problem might be related to water management or disease control.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Fungicide Application**: Since the leaves show signs of brown spots, consider applying a fungicide specifically formulated for grapevine diseases. Look for products labeled for use on grapes and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\n\n2. **Water Management**: Ensure proper drainage around the grapevines to prevent waterlogging, which can exacerbate fungal infections. Avoid overhead watering if possible, as it can increase the likelihood of disease spread.\n\n3. **Pruning and Ventilation**: Prune the grapevines to improve air circulation, which can help reduce the buildup of humidity and the spread of diseases. Proper spacing between vines also helps in preventing overcrowding, which can lead to more rapid growth and increased susceptibility to diseases.\n\n4. **Soil Management**: Assess the soil health and nutrient levels. If necessary, amend the soil with organic matter and nutrients. Ensure that the soil pH is within the ideal range for grapevines (between 5.5 and 6.5).\n\n5. **Monitoring and Early Detection**: Regularly monitor the grapevines for signs of disease or pest infestation. Early detection allows for prompt intervention before the problem becomes widespread.\n\n6. **Cultural Practices**: Practice good cultural practices such as avoiding overhead irrigation during periods of high humidity and ensuring that the vines are well-supported to allow for better air circulation and sunlight exposure.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can manage the growth of the grapevines while mitigating the effects of the observed issues, such as leaf spot caused by rain and rapid growth.",

Here are some recommended management strategies for dealing with these issues:\n\n1. **Identify the Pest:**\n   - Determine the exact type of pest present. Common pests on peach trees include aphids, scale insects, and mites. Proper identification will guide you on the appropriate control methods.\n\n2. **Monitor the Tree:**\n   - Regularly check the tree for signs of infestation, such as sticky residue from honeydew (produced by aphids), sooty mold growth, or distorted leaves and flowers. Monitoring helps to detect problems early before they become severe.\n\n3. **Physical Control:**\n   - In the early stages of an infestation, you can try physical removal methods such as swabbing or washing off the insects with a strong stream of water.\n\n4. **Cultural Control:**\n   - Ensure proper tree care, including adequate watering, fertilization, and pruning. Strong, healthy trees are better able to resist pests.\n\n5. **Biological Control:**\n   - Introduce natural predators that feed on the pests. For example, ladybugs and lacewings are beneficial for controlling aphids and other small insects.\n\n6. **Chemical Control:**\n   - If the infestation is severe, chemical treatments may be necessary. Choose pesticides that are effective against the specific pest identified. Be sure to follow the label instructions carefully and only use products approved for use on peach trees. Note that spraying should ideally be done early in the spring when the trees are still dormant to avoid harming beneficial insects.\n\n7. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Apply preventive sprays early in the growing season to protect the tree before pests become established. Consult with a local agricultural extension office for recommendations on suitable chemicals and application times for your area.\n\n8. **Consult Local Experts:**\n   - Seek advice from local agricultural extension agents who can provide tailored recommendations based on local conditions and available resources.\n\nBy implementing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively manage the pest problem on your young peach tree while minimizing environmental impact.",

The\nfirst image doesn\u2019t reveal anything important; it\u2019s an older leaf and can be\nremoved when it\u2019s tattered and yellow.</p>\n\n<p>The other 2 images, though, reveal a far more serious problem\nof herbicide damage (weed killers). This is most likely due to carryover\nherbicide that was in the manure you added to the garden. Tomatoes are\nextremely sensitive to several different herbicides, much more so than anything\nelse in your garden.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll find a complete explanation of herbicide-carryover at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/aminopyralid/images.html#img9\">http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/aminopyralid/images.html#img9</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, a restricted-use herbicide, available to\ncommercial users only, is commonly used on grass crops (including pastures),\nalso grain crops, the purpose to kill broadleaf weeds. As it turns out, some of\nthe product clings the grasses or grains which livestock eat. They pass through\nthe animals\u2019 gut without harming the livestock. The resulting manure which may\nthen be used by home gardeners will affect susceptible crops.\u00a0 Tomatoes are super-sensitive. </p>\n\n<p>To verify if the manure is the source of the problem, do a simple\nbio-assay as is explained at the above link. (The link for the bio-assay is at\nthe left of that page. )</p>\n\n<p>If the bio-assay is negative, we will need to explore which herbicides\nmay have been used nearby.\u00a0 The suspect products\nwill have 2,4-D on the ingredients list.</p>\n\n<p>If the bio-assay is positive, you can successfully grow corn\nin that area of the garden this year.\u00a0 Or\nyou can follow the information at the above link to speed degradation of the\ncausative herbicide. Water as if you had a crop in the ground, and till several\ntimes through the season. </p>\n\n<p>Next year, all should be well but, to be certain the tomatoes\nyou plant will thrive, repeat the bio-assay to ensure it is negative before you\nplant.</p>\n\n<br><br><br><br>",

They do bite people, mainly when folks are tending to their azaleas, but the bites are not considered dangerous in any way, just a nuisance. Wearing long sleeves, long pants and gardening gloves while working in your azaleas should be effective in preventing the bites. The good news is that azalea plant bugs tend to die out for the year in our area by mid July, so they won't be around too much longer at this point. In addition, as soon as the azaleas have stopped blooming, these insects move on to feed on other plants, such as raspberries and a variety of ornamental trees and shrubs such as spirea and plum.<br /> <br /> Below is a link with more information on azalea plant bugs.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/azalea-plant-bug\">https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/azalea-plant-bug</a><br /> <br /> I hope this is helpful.<br /> <br /> ~ Karin",

The presence of the slime mold could very well indicate consistently moist conditions, as they do not appear in areas that stay dry or dry quickly (sidewalks, etc).<br><br>Since the crown (main growth points at soil level) of the sod is not affected by brown patch, healthy grass blades should grow to replace the diseased ones. This may not happen more notably until fall, since Fescue is a cool-season grass which does semi-dormant in the heat of summer. As our nights begin to cool off at the end of summer, more vigorous growth should resume.<br><br>Miri",

                "answer": "The image shows a leaf with yellowing and possibly some discoloration at the edge, which could be indicative of various issues such as nutrient deficiencies, disease, or environmental stress. Given the location (Itasca County, Minnesota) and the time of year (June), it's possible that the plant is experiencing environmental stress due to recent heavy rain, which can lead to issues like root rot or nutrient imbalances.\n\nHere are some management strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Monitor Environmental Conditions**: Check if the soil drainage is adequate. Excessive moisture can lead to root rot, so ensure there is proper air circulation around the roots.\n\n2. **Adjust Watering Practices**: Reduce watering frequency and increase spacing between waterings to avoid overwatering. Ensure the soil is well-draining by adding organic matter like compost or perlite to improve aeration.\n\n3. **Check for Diseases**: Inspect other leaves on the plant for signs of disease. If you suspect a fungal infection like rust or blight, use a fungicide designed for roses. Apply according to the instructions on the label.\n\n4. **Nutrient Analysis**: Test the soil pH and nutrient levels. Rose plants require specific conditions, and if they are not getting the necessary nutrients, this could also cause discoloration. Use a balanced fertilizer tailored for roses, but be cautious not to over-fertilize, as this can also lead to issues.\n\n5. **Prune the Plant**: Remove any damaged or unhealthy leaves and branches. This can help reduce the spread of any diseases and encourage healthy growth.\n\n6. **Check for Pests**: Although not directly visible in the image, pests like aphids or mites can also cause leaf discoloration. Keep an eye out for signs of infestation and treat accordingly with appropriate insecticides.\n\n7. **Consult Local Extension Services**: If the problem persists, consider consulting with local extension agents who can provide more specific advice based on the local climate and conditions.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you can help manage the condition of your rose plant and potentially prevent further damage.",

                "response": "<p>Hi,</p> <p>To clarify 'Just planted it' - do you mean in the past few weeks or earlier in the spring? Dogwood trees the native <em>Cornus florida</em> species and the kousa species can get various leaf spots and most of the time time they are not to be too concerned about.</p> <p>Either way regarding when it was planted, this is most likely just transplant stress due to heat and drought. Even if you have watered regularly (see out tips for <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs\">watering trees and shrubs</a>) through the summer or upon planting, the tree will go through some shock with the dry soils and high temperatures and probably what you are seeing on the leaves.\u00a0</p> <p>There isn't a need for treating or spraying anything at this time since the tree is putting forth energy into establishing the root system. Its nearing the end of the growing season and the leaves will drop soon, maybe prematurely this year due to stress. Next spring it should leaf out as normal and you will just want to monitor for water needs through the fall, winter- if it isn't freezing and we haven't received precipitation you could supplement water through this season as well, and the following spring and summer. Trees need to be monitored for irrigation needs mainly for the first three growing years after being transplanted, but in dry growing seasons like this year, they need about an inch of water a week once established and we can't always relay on rain to provide that.\u00a0</p> <p>Should you have questions about the new Dogwood into the fall or next spring, feel free to send additional photos and continue to reach out.\u00a0</p> <p>Emily</p>",

        "question": "I live in Anoka County Minnesota along the Mississippi River. I have an oak tree that is shedding clumps of small branches with green leaves, lot of them. \u00a0It only seems to happen during the nighttime. I vacuumed \u00a0a bunch yesterday and now this morning my yard under the tree looks as though I never touched them. I cannot see a whole lot of stripping going on up in the tree because the tree is very healthy and green but I am sure if this continues the tree may die. Now about 100 feet away another oak is starting to get attacked. \u00a0We do have a lot of grey squirrels around the neighborhood but they have never bothered before. We do have Cooper Hawks, Bald Eagles and of course Raccoons. \u00a0I do hear what sounds to be a chirping bird coming out of the top of tree at night, but hard to believe a bird could do all that damage unless it is on a serious mission. \u00a0Any idea what it could be or what I can do to try and stop it before it kills the trees. \u00a0Thank you",

For starters give them a good watering ASAP - 10-15 minutes each on top of the area comprising the holes they were planted in.

                "answer": "The image shows a dried and yellowing leaf from a fig tree, which could be indicative of several issues such as nutrient deficiency, overwatering, or environmental stress. Given the context that the fig tree was planted in full sun and was initially watered daily but then switched to once a week, it's possible that the plant may have experienced overwatering followed by dehydration.\n\nHere is a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Assess Watering Schedule**: Review the watering schedule and adjust it accordingly. Since the tree was initially watered daily, it might need more frequent watering until it establishes itself. Once established, it should be watered less frequently, ideally every 5-7 days depending on weather conditions and soil moisture levels.\n\n2. **Check Soil Moisture**: Ensure that the soil is not consistently wet. Use a moisture meter or dig down into the soil to check if it is drying out properly. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.\n\n3. **Nutrient Analysis**: If the leaves continue to show signs of distress, consider having the soil tested to determine if there are any nutrient deficiencies. This will help tailor the fertilization plan appropriately.\n\n4. **Pruning and Maintenance**: Prune the tree regularly to encourage healthy growth and remove any dead or damaged leaves. This can help prevent the spread of disease and improve air circulation around the tree.\n\n5. **Monitor for Signs of Disease or Insect Pests**: Inspect the tree for signs of disease or insect infestation. If present, take appropriate action such as using organic pesticides or fungicides.\n\n6. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture and suppress weeds, which can help reduce competition for nutrients and water.\n\nBy closely monitoring the tree and adjusting care practices based on observed conditions, you can help the fig tree recover and thrive.",

Trees are also entering dormancy now so leaf loss now isn\u2019t as much of an issue as it would be early in the season. The damage was probably done by Japanese beetles and they are gone now.

Specifically, there appears to be a dark spot on one of the leaves, which could indicate a fungal or bacterial infection, or it might be a natural discoloration due to environmental stress or other factors.\n\nFor managing such issues in a maple tree, here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**: Determine the exact cause of the leaf damage (e.g., disease, pest infestation, environmental stress). This can involve observing the condition over time and consulting with a local arborist or horticulturist who can provide a more accurate diagnosis based on the specific symptoms observed.\n\n2. **Remove Diseased Parts**: If the damage is localized to specific areas of the leaf or small branches, carefully prune these out to prevent the spread of the disease. Ensure that you have proper pruning tools and that you make clean cuts at the point where healthy wood meets diseased wood.\n\n3. **Use Fungicides or Pesticides**: Depending on the identified cause, fungicides or pesticides may be necessary. These should only be applied according to the label instructions to ensure they are effective and safe for the environment and the tree.\n\n4. **Improve Tree Health**: Strengthening the overall health of the tree can help it better resist diseases. This includes ensuring the tree receives adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight, and that it is properly pruned to maintain good air circulation within the canopy.\n\n5. **Monitor the Tree**: Regularly check the tree for further signs of disease or stress. Early detection can lead to more effective management strategies.\n\n6. **Consult an Arborist**: For complex cases or if the tree shows significant signs of decline, consulting with a certified arborist can provide expert advice tailored to the specific situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the first step is to identify the cause of the damage, followed by targeted management actions such as pruning, potentially using chemical treatments, and improving the overall health of the tree.",

The soil beneath the plants and debris appears dark and moist, indicating recent rain or high humidity.\n\nThe image seems to have been taken during the daytime, as the lighting suggests natural sunlight filtering through overhead vegetation.",

It just looked like some strange red growth and I was not totally sure if it was normal or not. I pruned off the branch and the rose bloomed fine this spring and I saw no evidence of it. This fall I\u2019m seeing similar strange red growth on one of them again and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the same plant. How would I go about confirming if that is what it is? I know I need to get rid of the bush if that\u2019s the case. I have about 50 rose bushes so if it spreads it would be pretty devastating:(",

These trees can become invasive and therefore not desirable in the home landscape or pasture areas, though they can be used by birds for food (which is how the seeds are dispersed).<br /> The attached document from the US Dept of Agriculture discusses Russian Olive control, directed at large acreage areas rather than the home landscape, but the control strategies can be used on a smaller scale, where practical.<br /> Unfortunately, cutting back the trunks, which as you say is not very easy given the location, will not eradicate the plant, though that may be more practical than the careful use of an herbicide on cut stumps, as discussed in the USDA document.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Foliar herbicide sprays could work but are not practical given the tree's entanglement with the desirable shrub).\u00a0<br /> If you can carefully cut the trunks close to the ground and paint the exposed area with herbicide without touching the desirable shrub, this may begin to control the plant - you may need to do this in more than one season as other trunks grow from the root system.<br /> Some of the herbicides in the USDA document may not\u00a0 be available to home gardeners, though glyphosate and 2-4D are sold in retail garden centers.<br /> (It is at least useful to remove flowers before they go to seed so that birds don't eat and scatter the seeds and generate more plants.)<br /> <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5410126.pdf\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5410126.pdf</a><br /> <br /> See\u00a0also:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.extension.uidaho.edu/publishing/html/BUL976-Different-Treatment-Options-for-Russian-Olive.aspx#:~:text=%20Control%20Options%20%201%20Mowing.%20Russian%20olive,cutting%20with%20herbicide%20application.%20Trees%20are...%20More%20\">https://www.extension.uidaho.edu/publishing/html/BUL976-Different-Treatment-Options-for-Russian-Olive.aspx#:~:text=%20Control%20Options%20%201%20Mowing.%20Russian%20olive,cutting%20with%20herbicide%20application.%20Trees%20are...%20More%20</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=3949#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20herbicides%20and%20application%20techniques%20can,4%29%2C%20triclopyr%20%28Garlon%C2%AE%203A%29%2C%20or%20imazapyr%20%28Arsenal%C2%AE%2C%20Habitat%C2%AE%29\">https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=3949#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20herbicides%20and%20application%20techniques%20can,4%29%2C%20triclopyr%20%28Garlon%C2%AE%203A%29%2C%20or%20imazapyr%20%28Arsenal%C2%AE%2C%20Habitat%C2%AE%29</a>.<br /> <br /> We hope you can eradicate this plant, but it is not easy to do and at best requires persistence.<br /> <br /> Pat B",

Here are the prominent visual features observed:\n\n1. **Leaves**: The leaves are elongated and oval-shaped with smooth edges. They have a silvery-green coloration, which suggests they might be adapted to conserve water, indicating a possible xerophytic environment (dry habitat). The texture appears slightly rough or hairy, as indicated by the small bumps visible under magnification.\n\n2. **Buds**: Small, greenish-yellow buds are visible at various points along the stem. These buds appear to be in an early stage of development, suggesting that flowers may soon bloom from them.\n\n3. **Stem**: The stem is brownish-orange and has a smooth surface. It is sturdy and supports the growth of the leaves and buds.\n\n4. **Background**: The background is blurred but shows what seems to be a concrete surface, possibly part of a pathway or sidewalk, and some greenery that hints at an outdoor setting.\n\nGiven the location and date, it is likely that this plant is experiencing spring growth, as suggested by the presence of buds and the overall fresh appearance of the foliage. The specific species of the plant could be identified more accurately if additional details were known, such as the full form of the leaves or flowers when they bloom. However, based on the visual features alone, it aligns well with plants commonly found in dry or semi-arid regions, such as shrubs or succulents.",

                "response": "Thank you for your question. The snake in your photograph is a cottonmouth, scientific name Agkistrodon piscivorus. Alabama has one subspecies, the western cottonmouth, A. p. leucostoma,\u00a0and two intergrades. Intergrades are the result of the mating between two subspecies. Alabama has an eastern x western cross and an eastern x Florida cross. The exact identity of your cottonmouth is difficult to establish from just a photo. The cottonmouth is a venomous species.<br><br>Typical length is approximately two feet, and maximum length can reach approximately four feet. They are found from Virginia south to Florida and west to Texas. They can be found in river swamps, backwaters and floodplains. They are also common in lakes, reservoirs, ponds, streams and wetlands.<br><br>They have a varied diet that includes small mammals, birds, fish, frogs, salamanders, other snakes and occasionally baby alligators.<br><br>Local snake lore indicates that this species is very aggressive towards humans, but scientific research has shown that this is not the case, and, in fact, most cottonmouths are reluctant to bite. Nevertheless, they should be enjoyed from a safe distance. There common name comes from a defensive threat display in which the snake throws open its mouth, revealing the white lining of the mouth.<br><br>If you'd like to learn more about snakes in Alabama, here is an excellent field guide:<br><br>Gibbons, Whit.

They are a sucking insect.\u00a0Typically\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0gone\u00a0by the\u00a0time you\u00a0notice\u00a0the\u00a0damage. Parasitoids and general predators (ants, spiders, ladybugs, lacewings) help to reduce their numbers. Keep weeds down especially perennial weeds that may harbor their eggs.<br><br>No chemical controls are recommended for this.\u00a0It is okay to eat the herbs that do not have a lot of damage. Remove the badly damaged leaves and the plants should put out new growth.

Wintertime is the only time you'll typically see sapsuckers, so your viburnum should be left alone until they return later this year!\u00a0\u00a0Remember to only remove 1/3 of your viburnum at a time per year when pruning.

                "response": "Hello Hanzhen,<br /> <br /> Although we acknowledge it's an eyesore, this is fairly normal for how many Bigleaf Hydrangea varieties look this time of year, if it's any consolation. Several kinds of <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/hydrangea-identify-and-manage-problems\">leaf-spotting fungi or bacteria</a> can cause these symptoms, but fortunately they do not seriously harm the plant, despite looking a bit drastic. You do not need to treat the plant with a fungicide, nor would one be able to reverse the existing damage or cure an infection at this point. You can remove the fallen leaves this winter and throw them away, though, to reduce the likelihood of infection this widespread next year. It's not a foolproof measure because spores can still arrive on the wind, but wouldn't hurt to try.<br /> <br /> If you irrigate the yard, make sure the foliage either doesn't get wet (just water the soil around the base of the plant)\u00a0or water early enough in the day so it can dry by nightfall. Weather plays a large role in disease spread and severity, so an outbreak one year won't necessarily result in an infection that prolific the next. Wet weather and wet leaf surfaces generally allows for more successful spore infection of plant foliage, so maintaining good air circulation by not crowding plants and perhaps also <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pruning-shrubs-and-hedges-home-garden#:~:text=an%20overgrown%20shrub.-,Thinning%20shrubs,-Is%20the%20removal\">thinning-out dense stem growth</a> can help slow disease progression.<br /> <br /> As hydrangea blooms age and fade, they\u00a0usually dull in color and turn greener, or occasionally reddish, and then brown and dry. The state of the blooms in your photo look normal, though if they fade very quickly after opening, perhaps the plant is either drought-stressed or is planted in too much direct sun, since Bigleaf Hydrangea thrives in part-sun/part-shade. While full sun can help keep their leaves drier and therefore less vulnerable to infection, the higher light intensity can sunburn foliage, speed-up moisture loss, or fade flower colors. Some Bigleaf Hydrangea varieties are capable of producing new flowers throughout the summer and into autumn, but others just have the one bloom period earlier in summer and those flowers fade as blooming finishes. We can't tell which variety this is from its appearance alone, since there are dozens on the market these days, but if it is capable of reblooming, it will do so on its own. Avoid pruning it aside from thinning-out individual stems because this could interfere with the formation of flowers. You can, though, trim off just the spent\u00a0individual flower clusters that are brown if you don't like the look.<br /> <br /> The foliage does look slightly nutrient-deficient, which can happen if the soil is not acidic enough (acid soils have\u00a0a pH value below 7.0). Soils near concrete home foundations or brick mortar sometimes have a soil pH that's too high for acid-loving plants to thrive because of minerals leaching out of those materials, and this makes it harder for their roots\u00a0to absorb the nutrients they need. Fertilization sometimes helps, but when the pH is too high it needs to be lowered first, since the soil may already have plenty of nutrients in it. (In that situation, adding more doesn't help.) A <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/soil-testing-and-soil-testing-labs\">soil test</a> can reveal the pH level and let you know what, if any, adjustments are needed. Bigleaf Hydrangeas prefer a pH range from about 5.5 to 6.5, but not higher.<br /> <br /> Miri",

It appears that the trees were planted a bit deep, which may have put additional stress on the trees and their establishment. The past 6 months we have been subject to a great deal of fluctuation in moisture in northern Delaware, with rains coming heavy at times and leading to saturated soil. We also had a period of drought in September. The drain field adds to moisture when we get heavy rains. Evergreens also drop needles seasonally this time of year. You could dig down a bit around the base of the trees and check some of the roots to see if they are a good light color, or whether the roots are dark and show any rot. I would recommend that you re-evaluate the trees in the spring. Do not fertilize this season. The lichens on the trees are harmless and an indicator of good air quality. <br><br>Thank you for contacting Delaware Cooperative Extension,<br><br>Nancy<br><br>",

                "response": "The leaf symptoms are exhibiting \"scorch,\" which is usually due to\u00a0abiotic causes. (Abiotic factors are those not caused by a living thing, so are not tied to a pest or disease but rather to environmental conditions.) Stress from too much or too little soil moisture, even for a relatively brief amount of time compared to the rest of the growing season, is often the culprit when leaves scorch, especially on plants still establishing in their first couple of years in the ground.<br /> <br /> Was the plant's root ball loosened well or any matted roots disentangled when it was planted? Cherrylaurel can be sold potted or burlapped (the tag pictured suggests it was potted in a 6-gallon pot). Potted plants can easily become quite rootbound by the time they are sold, and the potting mix used in the container will retain and drain water very differently than the surrounding soil it's planted in. By well-loosening the roots just prior to planting, this not only helps them to establish by encouraging growth out into the soil that surrounds them, but also helps remove some of that potting mix from the core of the root ball so it can be blended with the soil from the planting hole. In doing so, this helps the soil more evenly absorb or drain water so the roots don't experience dry pockets or \"bathtub\"-like wet pools.\u00a0Either situation would result in stress, affecting leaf health, and at worst, root dieback, though unfortunately the symptoms of damage can be delayed from the onset of stress, making determining exactly what happened difficult.<br /> <br /> The best <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs\">way to judge when plants need water</a> is to feel the soil about 6 inches down in the root zone and watering thoroughly (for a plant this size, probably several gallons per session) once it becomes somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. If it is\u00a0damp instead when checked to that depth, watering can wait. As a very rough guideline because this will partly depend on soil type,\u00a0a Cherrylaurel of this size\u00a0planted in mid/late summer might need a thorough\u00a0watering once or twice a week if the weather is hot and mostly dry. (Rapid rainstorms don't always soak into the soil as much as we think they would for the volume of water falling, so plants should still be monitored after rain.)<br /> <br /> Damaged leaves cannot heal and may fall off, but as long as the branches themselves remain healthy (since they have dormant buds under the bark\u00a0that can help replace lost growth) and the roots remain in good condition, recovery is possible. That said, shrubs generally don't put out new growth this late in the growing season because they are preparing tissues for dormancy, so you might not see indications of regrowth and new leaf production until spring. Some of the browned leaves may be retained by the plant but others might fall off anytime between now and early winter, which would be normal for scorch symptoms. If more leaves \"winterburn\" during winter (this kind of scorch\u00a0might not become evident until spring due to a delay in symptoms) then we would suspect the roots were damaged at some point\u00a0and will have to catch up in regrowth to balance-out what amount of foliage they can support.<br /> <br /> There's nothing you can do for now except to keep monitoring the shrub for watering needs as we enter fall, especially since central MD has been in a <a href=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?MD\">drought</a> all season and in past years we have experienced autumn drought before. Don't fertilize, and if it isn't already, <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/mulching-trees-and-shrubs\">mulch the root zone</a> to help moderate soil temperatures and moisture, but make sure the mulch isn't covering any part of the trunk/stem base.<br /> <br /> Miri",

Given that the plant was only recently planted and its health is failing, it's important to consider these factors:\n\n### Potential Causes:\n1. **Nutrient Deficiency**: Young plants often require more frequent watering and nutrient-rich soil to establish properly. If the soil lacks essential nutrients like nitrogen, iron, or magnesium, the leaves might turn yellow or brown at the edges.\n2. **Watering Issues**: Overwatering or underwatering can also cause leaf discoloration. Ensure the soil is well-drained and watered consistently but not excessively.\n3. **Environmental Stress**: Extreme temperatures or strong winds can stress young plants, leading to leaf damage.\n4. **Pest or Disease**: Insects or fungal diseases can affect new plants, especially if they haven't fully established their defenses yet.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n1. **Check Soil Conditions**:\n   - Assess the soil moisture level regularly. Ensure the plant is not sitting in standing water or drying out too quickly.\n   - Add a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) if you suspect nutrient deficiency. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on application rates.\n   \n2. **Watering**:\n   - Water the plant deeply once a week during the growing season. Adjust according to weather conditions and soil type.\n\n3. **Monitor for Pests and Diseases**:\n   - Inspect the leaves and stems for signs of pests or disease. Look for mites, aphids, or any discoloration that might indicate a fungal infection.\n   - Treat with an appropriate pesticide if necessary, ensuring you follow the label instructions carefully.\n\n4. **Supportive Care**:\n   - Provide additional support to the plant, especially if it\u2019s still young and weak. Use stakes if needed.\n   - Ensure the plant is in a location with adequate light and protection from harsh weather.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**:\n   - If the plant continues to show signs of distress despite your efforts, consult with a local horticulturist or extension agent who can provide specific advice based on local conditions.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues methodically, you can help improve the health and vitality of your newly planted cherry laurel.",

        "question": "I am having a problem with a Miami Crape Myrtle. Two years ago one of the main trunps died. There was a split near the base of the trunk. Since then I have noticed white patches all over the bark (picture attached). Last year another trunk did not leaf out in the the spring. Again, there was a split near the base. Another two trunks had some bark problem near the ground. I suspected Crape Myrtle bark scale and applied a drench of Imidacloprid in early summer of 2018. The shrub appeared heathy and the appearance of the bark improved and the  the damaged area near the base of two trunks appeared to be healed. This spring two additional trunks are dead, again with splits near the ground and white ares all over the bark. I doubt that it is weather related since I have grown the same variety of crape myrtle without problems for 20y. I can send a sample if needed but you may be able to diagnose from the two attached pictures. Thanks!",

Given that the questioner has had success with Imidacloprid treatments in the past, it's possible that the current issue might be related to insect infestation or environmental stress. Here are some recommended management strategies based on the information provided:\n\n### 1. **Further Inspection:**\n   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the entire tree, including the trunk, branches, and leaves. Look for signs of insects (e.g., borers, aphids), fungi, or other pathogens.\n\n### 2. **Pest Identification:**\n   - If signs of insects are found, identify the specific pest. This will help determine if Imidacloprid can be used again or if a different treatment is needed. For instance, if it\u2019s borers, you may need a systemic insecticide.\n\n### 3. **Environmental Stress Management:**\n   - Check the soil moisture levels and adjust irrigation as necessary. Ensure the tree is receiving adequate nutrients by testing the soil pH and nutrient levels. Consider applying a balanced fertilizer if deficiencies are detected.\n\n### 4. **Pruning:**\n   - Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth and reduce the risk of further infection. Make clean cuts using sharp, disinfected tools to avoid introducing more pathogens.\n\n### 5. **Tree Health Maintenance:**\n   - Continue regular monitoring for signs of stress or disease. Early detection and intervention can prevent the spread of pests and diseases.\n\n### 6. **Consultation with an Arborist:**\n   - If the problem persists or worsens, consult with a local arborist or horticulturist who can provide expert advice tailored to your location and specific conditions.\n\n### 7. **Reapplication of Imidacloprid:**\n   - If Imidacloprid was effective in previous years, consider reapplying it at the appropriate time for pest control. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for dosage and timing carefully.\n\n### 8. **Consider Alternative Treatments:**\n   - If Imidacloprid does not prove effective, explore alternative treatments such as botanical insecticides or fungicides designed specifically for crape myrtles.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can better manage the health of your crape myrtle and potentially resolve the issue seen in the image. Regular maintenance and vigilance will also help maintain the overall health of the tree over time.",

                "response": "<p>Tree wounds are common and the causes include: broken\nbranches; impacts, abrasions and scrapes; animal damage; insect attack; fire;\netc. Wounds usually break the bark and damage the food and water conducting\ntissues. Wounds also expose the inside of the tree to organisms, primarily\nbacteria and fungi that may infect and cause discoloration and decay of the\nwood. Decay can result in structurally weakened tree stems and can shorten the\nlife of a tree. Decay cannot be cured. However, proper tree care can limit the\nprogress of decay in an injured tree.</p>\n\n<p>Trees respond to wounding or injury in two ways:\ncompartmentalization and the development of barrier zones.</p>\n\n<p>When a tree is wounded, the injured tissue is not repaired\nand does not heal. Trees do not heal; they seal. If you look at an old wound,\nyou will notice that it does not \u201cheal\u201d from the inside out, but eventually the\ntree covers the opening by forming specialized \u201ccallus\u201d tissue around the edges\nof the wound. After wounding, new wood growing around the wound forms a\nprotective boundary preventing the infection or decay from spreading into the\nnew tissue. Thus, the tree responds to the injury by \u201ccompartmentalizing\u201d or\nisolating the older, injured tissue with the gradual growth of new, healthy\ntissue.</p>\n\n<p>Not only do trees try to close the damaged tissue from the\noutside, they also make the existing wood surrounding the wound unsuitable for\nspread of decay organisms. Although these processes are not well understood,\nthe tree tries to avoid further injury by setting chemical and physical\nboundaries around the infected cells, reacting to the pathogen and confining\nthe damage.</p>\n\n<p>If the tree is fast and effective with its boundary-setting\nmechanisms, the infection remains localized and does not spread. However, if\nthe boundary-setting mechanisms are not effective, the infection will spread.\nMost vigorous or actively growing trees are fairly successful in coping with\ndecay-spreading mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Tree wounds often appear ragged where the bark is torn\nduring the injury. This is common during branch breakage and when the trunk of\nthe tree has been scraped. To repair this type of damage, cut off any ragged\nbark edges with a sharp knife. Take care not to remove any healthy bark and\nexpose more live tissue than necessary. If possible, the wound should be shaped\nlike an elongated oval, with the long axis running vertically along the trunk\nor limb. All bark around the wound should be tight.</p>\n\n<p>Research indicates that wound dressings (materials such as\ntar or paint) do not prevent decay and may even interfere with wound closure.\nWound dressings can have the following detrimental effects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Prevent\n     drying and encourage fungal growth</li>\n <li>Interfere\n     with formation of wound wood or callus tissue</li>\n <li>Inhibit\n     compartmentalization</li>\n <li>Possibly\n     serve as a food source for pathogens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For these reasons, applying wound dressings is not\nrecommended. Trees, like many organisms, have their own mechanisms to deter the\nspread of decay organisms, insects and disease</p>\n\n<p>Filling large holes or hollows in the tree is generally done\nfor cosmetic reasons. There is little data to indicate that a filled tree has\nbetter mechanical stability. However, fillings may give the callus tissue a\nplace to seat, thus stopping the in-roll (folding) of the callus (Shigo 1982).\nAlmost any filling can be used as long as it does not abrade the inside of the\ntree.</p>\n\n<p>Filling a tree cavity is generally expensive and not\nrecommended. Filling does not stop decay and often during the cleaning of the\ncavity, the boundary that separates the sound wood or the callus growth from\nthe decayed wood is ruptured. Thus, this cleaning for cavity filling can have\nmore detrimental effects on the tree than if it were left alone. Care must be\ntaken not to damage the new callus tissue that has formed in response to the tree\ndamage and subsequent decay.</p>\n\n<p>Proper pruning should be used to remove dead, dying and\nbroken branches; to remove low, crossing or hazardous branches; and to control\nthe size of the tree. However, pruning of any kind places some stress on the\ntree by removing food-producing leaves (if the branch is alive), creating\nwounds that require energy to seal, and providing possible entry points for\ndisease.</p>\n\n<p>Pruning cuts should be made to maximize the tree\u2019s ability\nto close its wound and defend itself from infection. When pruning, make clean,\nsmooth cuts. Do not leave branch stubs. Leave a small collar of wood at the\nbase of the branch. The branch collar is a slightly swollen area where the\nbranch attaches to the trunk. Cutting the limb flush with the trunk will leave\na larger area to callus over and a greater chance of decay organisms entering\nthe wound. The optimal pruning time is in the winter (dormant season) when\ntemperatures and infection rates are lower and when trees are not actively\ngrowing.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion. Healthy trees usually recover from wounding\nquickly. Try to keep wounded trees growing vigorously by watering them during\ndroughts and providing proper fertilization. This will increase the rate of\nwound closure, enhance callus growth and improve the resistance to decay\nmechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of publications\nyou may find useful:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://agrilife.org/treecarekit/after-the-storm/tree-wounds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://agrilife.org/treecarekit/after-the-storm/tree-wounds/</a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/HYG-3311-09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/HYG-3311-09</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/publications/understanding-pruning-and-injury-wounds-fruit-trees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/publications/understanding-pruning-and-injury-wounds-fruit-trees</a></p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",

The photos show\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-identify-and-manage-common-problems\">boxwood mite damage (white 'stippling' or specks on the leaves), boxwood psyllid (white secretions on the leaves)</a>, and some <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/winter-damage-landscape-plants\">winter injury</a> (the orange-burnt leaves).<br /><br />Blasting the plant with the hose and trimming and disposing of the damaged leaves will help to reduce the pests and it will also remove the winter damage. Remember to only prune 1/3 of the shrub at any one time per year. Our guide to pruning boxwoods might interest you: <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-leafminer-shrubs\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-leafminer-shrubs</a></p> <p>It does not look like the infestation is heavy enough to warrant spraying.\u00a0If you see these next year, boxwood psyllid nymphs may be controlled with horticultural oil or insecticidal soap sprays in April and May. The psyllids will now be into adulthood, so if you must use a spray, you can use a registered residual insecticide in late May into June.</p> <p>It is good to familiarize yourself with the signs of <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/boxwood-blight\">boxwood blight</a> - you can check the stems for black 'lesions' or black spots. Usually by the time these would appear, about 50% of the boxwood would already be defoliated.\u00a0</p> <p>Jamie</p>",

                "answer": "The image shows boxwood plants that appear to have some form of damage or disease. Common issues affecting boxwoods include boxwood blight, fungal diseases, and insect infestations such as boxwood adelgids. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis and potential management strategies:\n\n### Potential Issues:\n1. **Boxwood Blight (Buxus sempervirens var. sempervirens)**:\n   - Symptoms: Brown to reddish-brown lesions on leaves, often leading to leaf drop, and cankers on stems.\n   - Management: Remove and destroy affected branches, prune healthy branches back into healthy wood, and apply fungicides if necessary. Avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on foliage.\n\n2. **Fungal Diseases**:\n   - Symptoms: Fuzzy white or gray patches on leaves, stem rot, or wilting.\n   - Management: Prune away diseased parts, remove infected leaves, and improve air circulation around the plant. Apply appropriate fungicides if the problem persists.\n\n3. **Boxwood Adelgids**:\n   - Symptoms: White, cottony masses on twigs and branches, stunted growth, and yellowing of leaves.\n   - Management: Remove the adelgid-infested twigs by hand, spray with horticultural oil or insecticidal soap, and apply neem oil as a preventive measure.\n\n4. **Environmental Stress**:\n   - Symptoms: Yellowing or browning of leaves, overall poor vigor.\n   - Management: Ensure adequate watering, proper fertilization, and avoid overwatering. Consider adjusting pruning practices to maintain air circulation and health.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n1. **Visual Inspection**: Carefully inspect the entire plant for signs of disease or pest infestation. Look for symptoms such as discoloration, deformity, or any visible pests.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Prune dead or dying branches back to healthy wood. Use clean, sharp shears and disinfect them between cuts to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - Watering: Ensure consistent but not excessive watering. Avoid wetting the foliage, especially during the cooler part of the day.\n   - Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer according to the soil test results. Over-fertilizing can stress the plant and make it more susceptible to diseases.\n\n4. **Chemical Control**:\n   - If fungal diseases are suspected, use a systemic fungicide like mancozeb or thiophanate-methyl. Follow the label instructions carefully",

These typically can include insect invasion or environmental stress. This season (2022) we have had reports of gall formation in tomatoes similar to what you are observing. We believe that this is attributable to some of very hot temperatures during July. These small nodules in your picture should not be harmful to the plants nor to the tomato fruit. You can probably just ignore them.

Make sure to shield your nose and mouth so that you don't inhale dried and aerosolized excretions of the mice. Bromethalin is a fast-acting toxin with no known antidote. Therefore I wouldn't expect animals to roam far before collapsing. Because of its toxicity and lack of antidote, bromethalin products are a hazard to non-target wildlife, pets, and humans, so be cautious with it. <br>To combat the mouse problem in the trailer, try to identify where they're entering (unless they have colonized the walls) and use steel wool and/or other tough materials to exclude them. Trap out the remaining animals and then monitor closely so you can quickly detect any further incursions.<br>I hope this information is helpful,<br>Dana<br>",

The best you can do is pull up the\nplant and discard it in the trash (do not compost it). If you can still find\ntomatoes at a nursery, there is still time to plant them.

This non-native insect feeds on plant sap and doesn't harm people, but can be a nuisance because they try to overwinter indoors where it's milder than outside.

The focus is on a plant with small, delicate leaves that appear to have a smooth texture. These leaves are arranged in a somewhat linear fashion along slender stems, which are slightly curved and interwoven. Some of the leaves have a pale green hue, while others display a more vibrant green color. There are also some brown, dried leaves scattered among the green foliage, suggesting a natural environment where some plant material has decomposed. The ground is covered with a mix of grass and leaf litter, indicating a lush but possibly untamed area. The lighting suggests it was taken during the late afternoon, as indicated by the time stamp.",

            "1": {
                "response": "This is blossom end rot (BER), a common tomato disorder. It is caused by a calcium deficiency - not because the soil lacks calcium, but because the tomato plant cannot take in the calcium. There are several reasons that this happens: uneven watering and other weather related phenomena, root disturbance and over-fertilizing. Also, some varieties are more prone to get BER than others ('Roma' is notorious for BER). Tomatoes grown in pots have trouble with it, possibly because of uneven watering.  Read here:<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/blossom-end-rot/\">https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/blossom-end-rot/</a><br>The non-rot portion of the tomato is still perfectly edible. In the future, pay attention to watering and cultivating around the plants, and don't over fertilize. I'd also recommend switching to another paste tomato variety. There are varieties that allegedly aren't prone to get BER. Unfortunately, nurseries often offer 'Roma' as their only choice for paste tomato.<br>\n",

Since it's a sweet shrub (Calycanthus floridus), which typically thrives in moist, well-drained soil with partial shade, it's important to assess the plant's growing conditions.\n\nHere\u2019s a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Watering**: Ensure the plant is receiving consistent moisture but not excess water. The soil should be kept moist but not soggy. Consider reducing watering if there is significant rainfall or if the area is prone to waterlogging.\n\n2. **Soil Conditions**: Check the soil pH and nutrient levels. Sweet shrubs prefer acidic to neutral soil. Test the soil to determine if adjustments need to be made using fertilizers or amendments like peat moss or sulfur.\n\n3. **Pest Control**: Inspect the plant for any signs of pests. If you suspect pests, identify them and take appropriate measures. Common pests on sweet shrubs include aphids, scale insects, and mites. Use insecticidal soaps or neem oil as natural remedies, or consult with a local extension service for recommendations.\n\n4. **Shade and Sunlight**: Provide partial shade to protect the plant from direct sunlight, especially if the area experiences intense heat. Ensure the plant is not receiving too much direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch.\n\n5. **Pruning**: If the leaves are severely damaged, consider pruning back the affected areas to encourage new growth. However, avoid pruning too much as this could weaken the plant.\n\n6. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.\n\n7. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the plant\u2019s health over time. Regularly check for signs of recovery or further decline and adjust care accordingly.\n\nIf the issue persists despite these steps, consider consulting a horticulturist or a local nursery specialist who can provide more tailored advice based on the specific conditions of your location.",

The fungus does little physical damage to the tree unless it is so severe that leaves coated with sooty mold cannot photosynthesize and create food for the tree. The insects may be a greater problem, but even then they may not be a major problem. The greatest effect is the aesthetic damage. Some people do not want to have dark bark on a tree that should have a lighter colored bark. Others are just worried that this is a problem that could permanently damage or kill their tree.</p><p>While permanent damage is possible, it will take years, so you have time to deal with the problem. The method of managing this problem is to manage the insects. The problem is probably due to aphids that feed by sucking juices from the leaves and twigs without chewing on them. They may be treated with several insecticides. However, if the damage to the tree is not too severe and the need for removal of the insects is not too urgent, try alternative methods to allow natural predators to assist. In the spring before the leaves appear, spray the branches and trunk with a horticultural oil spray (according to label direction). This will remove some overwintering insects with minimal damage to the beneficial insect population. As the tree begins growing and the insects begin excreting honeydew, it is time to spray. Use a strong jet of water to wash aphids from the leaves. Aphids will drop easily from the leaves when disturbed. Many will land on lower leaves, but washing will remove them to the ground. You may not be able to reach the top of an 80-foot-tall tree without a power washer or commercial spray device, but even if you don't reach the top of the tree, you can reduce the severity of the problem. This will also reduce the damage being done to the tree. Beneficial insects will help manage the problem in the top of the tree since you are not using insecticides that will kill them. The next line of defense will be to employ insecticidal soap (don't use in the heat of the summer) or other least-toxic insecticides. The purpose is to affect the aphid population with minimum impact on the population of beneficial insects.</p><p>Any time you use insecticides, organic or synthetic, it is important that you read, understand, and follow the label directions.</p>",

The overall appearance suggests that the tree could be an older one, as such bark often develops over time due to natural wear and tear, weathering, or disease.\n\nThe image does not provide enough context to definitively identify the specific species of the tree. However, the characteristics observed\u2014like the depth and complexity of the grooves, along with the presence of flakes and lighter areas\u2014are common in many deciduous trees found in temperate regions.

This can be done every 10 days but sulfur will burn so if you buy a concentrate, follow the directions exactly and wear protective clothing, gloves and safety glasses.<br /> After you remove the grass, you can add some composted manure and water it in.\u00a0 You can also use a non-manure compost as a mulch around the tree after you put the manure on.\u00a0 \u00a0Put it about 5 inches from the trunk so the rodents cannot hide in it and chew on the trunk and make the mulch as least 12 inches wide and about 6 inches deep.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> While it has been raining almost not stop, it looks like the weather is going to get hot and the mulch will help the soil stay moist.<br /> You can switch off your sprays and it may help kill the fungal disease faster, like taking two antibiotics if you were sick.\u00a0 You can purchase pure Neem oil online.\u00a0 The Neem oils that come prepackaged in a mix have unknow ingredients in them.\u00a0 If you use the sulfur and then pure Neem, both are organically approved and following the directions, you will be able to eat the fruit from the tree.\u00a0 Both the sulfur and the Neem oil have restrictions on how often to spray.\u00a0 Wait at least the 10 days between spraying the sulfur and going\u00a0to the Neem oil.<br /> The fungal disease on your tree looks severe.\u00a0 Stay with the spray program as directed on the packages and watch the leaves for new growth.<br /> Here is a link about planting, pests and disease:\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/berries-fruit/fruit-tree-pest-management\">https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/berries-fruit/fruit-tree-pest-management</a><br /> and one more:<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/berries-fruit/planting-caring-fruit-tree\">https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/berries-fruit/planting-caring-fruit-tree</a><br /> If you have further questions, please contact us again.",

In the last 2 weeks we have notice many small branches dropping with leaves.  I have attached a couple of photos.  Some of the small branches are dying on the tree and dropping.  Wondering if we have a disease.  A couple of other neighbors also mentioned they have the same problem other another street close to our street.  We also noticed some sap falling from one tree onto my neighbor's car.  If I bring in a fresh cut branch can I have it tested for disease?",

There are several types of rust\u00a0which include cedar apple rust, cedar quince rust, and cedar hawthorne rust. It does not kill the trees but obviously are very disfiguring. This can be common in cool wet weather. In all cases, the disease has alternate hosts, one being a juniper tree or shrub and the other being a plant in the rosaceae family. Other pomaceous hosts may include serviceberry, apple, crabapple trees, etc.The most common alternate host in this area is the Eastern Red Cedar which is actually a juniper.</p><p>The disease is always lurking waiting for the right weather conditions to attack the tree. It is also air-borne and can be blown into the landscape on the wind. The best recommendation is to select disease resistant varieties. However, resistant varieties are not immune.\u00a0Fungicides are not practical as you would have to spray consistently for two months in the spring in order to control it.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/rust-diseases-trees-and-shrubs\">http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/rust-diseases-trees-and-shrubs</a></p><p>At this point there is nothing that you can do.

Which is ok because plants have grown elsewhere and I like them because of the pollinators. However some have started taking over from other native plants. My gardens are 95% native so it breaks my heart  to remove these inconvenient plants. However today I spent hours trying to dig some out. If the long, dense fibrous roots weren\u2019t enough there is also some hard impenetrable \u201cgrowing part\u201d. I will have to resort to some kind of chemical warfare. Any suggestions? Thanks",

Check around the base of the shrub and make sure that the bark is intact and has not been stripped away by animals or weed whips.  If the bark is intact, the shrub leafed out normally this spring and the damage was evident immediately after herbicide application, then it it is likely that the herbicide was responsible.  In order for that kind of damage to occur,  the concentration of the weed killer had to be too high.  Unfortunately at this point there is nothing you can do other than flushing the root zone with water.  Trees and shrubs can recover from minor herbicide damage.  Scrape a little of the bark off the branches to see if they are alive.  The interior wood should be light green to white.  If the wood is tan to brown, the branch is dead.  If the branches are still alive you can wait and see if the shrub pushes out new leaves.  If it doesn't, you will have to replace it.

Given the context provided, it seems that the burning bush was treated with herbicides (2,4-D amine and quinclorac) on May 9, 2017. The treatment is likely intended to control an invasive species, but there might be some unintended damage.\n\nHere are the recommended steps for managing this situation:\n\n1. **Monitor the Bush**: Continue monitoring the bush for signs of recovery or further decline. It's important to observe whether new growth appears from the dead branches or if there is any sign of regrowth from the treated areas.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Herbicide Application**: Assess the method and timing of the herbicide application. Ensure that the application was done correctly and followed the recommended rates and timing as per the product label. Sometimes, improper application can lead to unintended damage.\n\n3. **Consider Reapplication**: If the affected branches do not show signs of recovery within a reasonable time frame (e.g., a few weeks), consider reapplying the herbicide. However, be cautious and consult with a professional if you decide to proceed with a second application.\n\n4. **Control Other Burning Bushes**: Since the other burning bushes nearby are very healthy, ensure that no additional burning bushes in the area have been inadvertently treated. This could require re-evaluating the boundaries and the method of application.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**: If the issue persists or if there are concerns about the effectiveness of the treatment, consulting with a horticulturist or a professional weed scientist can provide more specific advice tailored to your location and conditions.\n\n6. **Alternative Management Options**: If the herbicide approach is not effective, alternative methods such as manual removal or biological control might be considered. However, these options should be evaluated carefully to avoid causing further environmental harm.\n\nIn summary, the immediate focus should be on monitoring the treated area, ensuring proper application of herbicides, and seeking professional advice if necessary to address the issue effectively and safely.",

In the fall, rake up and destroy the infected leaves. Removing these leaves will reduce disease spores next spring. There are some fungicides registered for home use, they need to be applied at petal fall, shucksplit and again 2 weeks later. Shucksplit is when small, young fruit shed the papery sheath covering them shortly after bloom. Based on your description of cankers and oozing, it sounds like you are also dealing with <a href=\"https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/cherry-prunus-spp-bacterial-canker\">bacterial canker</a>.

Given that it is located close to a front door and the species is a hornet, which can be aggressive and potentially dangerous, the recommended management strategy should prioritize safety and professional assistance.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Contact a Professional**: It is highly recommended to contact a licensed pest control expert or an exterminator who specializes in wasp and hornet removal. They have the necessary equipment and expertise to safely remove the nest without causing harm to themselves or the bees.\n\n2. **Do Not Attempt Removal Yourself**: Attempting to remove a wasp or hornet nest yourself can be extremely risky. The wasps may defend their nest by stinging anyone who gets too close. This could lead to serious injury or death if the individual is allergic to bee venom.\n\n3. **Remove Any Attraction**: Before calling for help, it might be a good idea to reduce any attractants that could draw more wasps to the area. Remove any sugary substances, pet food, and other foods that might be left out. Ensure that any trash cans are tightly sealed.\n\n4. **Use Barriers**: If you live near a nest but do not want to remove it immediately, you can create barriers around the nest to prevent wasps from entering your home. This can include sealing cracks in the foundation, covering vents, and using mesh netting over windows and doors.\n\n5. **Monitor the Situation**: Keep an eye on the nest to ensure it does not grow larger or become more of a threat. If you notice signs of increased activity or if the nest starts to grow significantly, it may be time to call for professional help.\n\nIn summary, the safest and most effective approach is to contact a professional exterminator to handle the nest safely and effectively.",

Given the context provided, which includes the tree going through a typical fall in 2013 followed by a harsh winter, it's important to consider the potential impacts on the tree's health.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Assess the Tree Health**:\n   - **Examine the Tree**: Look for any signs of bark damage, dead branches, or unusual discoloration. The tree appears to have some leaf loss, which could be a sign of stress from the previous winter.\n   - **Check for Pest Infestation**: Inspect the trunk and branches for signs of borers or other pests that might be affecting the tree.\n\n2. **Pruning**:\n   - **Deadwood Removal**: Remove any dead or dying branches. This can help reduce the risk of further damage from wind or storms.\n   - **Promote New Growth**: If the tree is stressed, pruning can help stimulate new growth and improve its overall health. However, avoid over-pruning as this can weaken the tree further.\n\n3. **Watering**:\n   - **Monitor Water Needs**: During the summer months, ensure the tree receives adequate water, especially if it's experiencing stress due to the cold winter. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.\n\n4. **Mulching**:\n   - **Apply Mulch**: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around the base of the tree, but not touching the trunk. This helps retain moisture and suppress weeds, which can compete for nutrients.\n\n5. **Fertilizing**:\n   - **Apply Fertilizer**: Use a balanced fertilizer designed for shade trees to provide necessary nutrients. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions carefully, as too much fertilizer can harm the tree.\n\n6. **Staking**:\n   - **Support Young Trees**: If the tree is still young and vulnerable, consider staking it to prevent wind damage.\n\n7. **Protection from Pests and Diseases**:\n   - **Monitor for Pests**: Keep an eye out for signs of pests such as aphids, borers, or scale insects.\n   - **Apply Treatments**: If necessary, use appropriate insecticides or fungicides as directed by a professional arborist.\n\n8. **Consult an Arborist**:\n   - **Professional Advice**: Given the specific history of the tree, consulting with a certified arborist would be beneficial. They can provide a more detailed assessment and tailored management plan based",

Hand removal of adult beetles and placing them in a\npail of soapy water is considered to be the most effective means of dealing\nwith them.\u00a0 However as you remove the\nbeetles from your gardens, more beetles will fly in. \u00a0This means that this will be an ongoing, daily\nbattle for you.\u00a0 A one-time treatment by\nsomeone visiting your property will only be a temporary solution.\u00a0 As far as we know there is no spray that will\nrepel Japanese Beetles.\u00a0 You may want to\nconsider trying to destroy grubs in your soil sometime towards August.

We used organic compost and fertilizer when planting the tree, and it did fine last year spring, and summer of 2021; just no blooms. This year we were excited because we had spring blooms after pruning. No signs of other problems on any of our newly planted fruit trees even after our Ice storm (all planted in  \r\nFall of 2020 during planting season). However, we noticed in late March early April that our Bartlet Pear tree had these Fuchsia pink bump and some our clustered together. We have tried Neem oil, organic orchard spray, and then recently a organic sulfur spray. Nothing has seemed to work. It seems to even be on newly emerging bud leaves that haven't even opened yet. I can't fine anything that looks like what the tree has online when doing my research. So I am hoping you can help identify what is attacking my pear tree before it spreads to the rest of my grove. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

These microscope mites overwinter in the leaf buds &amp; scales. The mites feed on the developing leaves and cause that thickening and discoloration.<br /> <br /> Timing of the spray is really key. You need to smother the mites that are overwintering on the leaf buds before they start feeding. A fall application of lime sulfur can be helpful. Unfortunately, lime sulfur is really hard to find right now. You may need to call around to yard &amp; garden,\u00a0 hardware stores or farm stores to track some down.\u00a0A spring application of superior/dormant\u00a0horticulture oil right when the buds are developing will work, too. You'll have to keep an eye on the tree and cross your fingers there are some dry days when the buds are in the right stage. There is nothing to be sprayed right now so\u00a0just mark your calendars for the fall &amp; spring.\u00a0 It may take a couple of seasons to get the problem reduced to an acceptable level.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Find out more about the life cycle of eroiphyid mites here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://pnwhandbooks.org/insect/tree-fruit/pear/pear-eriophyid-mite\">https://pnwhandbooks.org/insect/tree-fruit/pear/pear-eriophyid-mite</a>\u00a0<br /> Take a look and let me know what additional questions you have.\u00a0",

I cannot identify it from the pictures on the web, but I'm sure you all can. As for my grass (what's left of it) it is patchy. The ground is hard. Does it require lime? Aeration? Top soil and over seeding? We live in Clarksburg, MD (Montgomery County).The grass is in part shade in some areas and full sun in others. The area that struggles is in part shade. As for the weeds, I began to notice them about 2-3 years ago. They have gotten steadily worse over the years. I fertilize my grass typically once, in the early spring with Scott's Turf Builder. I would like to know the following:\n\nWhat is this weed?\nHow do I get rid of it?\nWhat can I do to get my grass to come back?\n\nSee my pictures that are attached.\nThank you.",

It's important to identify the specific issue before recommending a management strategy. Here are some common issues that could be affecting cherry trees and possible solutions:\n\n### Possible Issues:\n1. **Bacterial Canker**: This disease can cause discolored or dead spots on the bark, which may lead to the death of branches if not addressed. Management includes pruning out affected areas and maintaining good sanitation by removing infected parts.\n\n2. **Cherry Tree Fruit Fly**: This pest can lay eggs in the fruit, leading to deformities or the fruit dropping prematurely. Management involves cultural practices such as covering fruits with netting to prevent oviposition, and biological control using predatory wasps.\n\n3. **Cherry Brown Rot**: This fungal disease affects the fruit, causing them to turn brown and fall off. Management involves removing infected fruit and pruning to improve air circulation around the tree.\n\n4. **Cherry Bark Beetle**: These insects can bore into the bark and\u6728\u8d28\u7ec4\u7ec7 (wood), potentially leading to tree decline. Management strategies include physical barriers like tree guards and tree wraps, and chemical treatments like systemic insecticides.\n\n5. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Insufficient nutrients can affect the tree\u2019s health, leading to poor fruit development. Management includes soil testing to determine nutrient needs and applying fertilizers accordingly.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n1. **Visual Inspection**: First, carefully inspect the tree to determine the exact nature of the issue. Look for signs of insect activity, fungal growth, or nutrient deficiencies.\n   \n2. **Sanitation Practices**: Remove and destroy any infected fruit, leaves, or branches to prevent the spread of diseases.\n\n3. **Pruning**: If the issue is bacterial canker or similar, prune out the affected branches at least 1 inch below the diseased area. Ensure clean tools are used and treated with a disinfectant between cuts.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**: Apply mulch to keep the soil moist and cool, which helps in reducing stress on the tree. Avoid overwatering, as cherry trees prefer well-drained soils.\n\n5. **Insect Control**: If pests are present, consider using organic or synthetic insecticides depending on the severity and type of pest.\n\n6. **Nutrient Management**: Test the soil to determine if there are any nutrient deficiencies. If necessary, apply appropriate fertilizers. Avoid overfertilization, as excess nitrogen can promote leafy growth at the expense of fruit production.\n\n7.",

                "answer": "The image shows a plant with slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers, which aligns with the description of fringed willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum). The plant appears to be growing taller than intended, as it does not seem to be functioning as a ground cover as initially planted.\n\nGiven that the plant was originally planted as a ground cover but is now growing taller and not fulfilling its intended role, here are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant. This can help suppress weeds and reduce competition for nutrients and water. It might also encourage the plant to grow more vigorously in the desired manner.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Consider pruning the plant to control its height. Regularly cutting back the stems can encourage the plant to develop a more bushy growth habit, resembling a ground cover. Be sure to remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth.\n\n3. **Shade**: If the plant is receiving too much sunlight, consider providing shade or partial shade. Fringed willowherb prefers full sun to part shade, so adjusting the planting location could help.\n\n4. **Watering**: Monitor the watering needs of the plant. Overwatering can lead to taller growth, while under-watering can stunt growth. Adjust watering according to the specific needs of the plant, ensuring it receives adequate moisture without being overwatered.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Fringed willowherb may benefit from a balanced fertilizer application, particularly if the soil is nutrient-deficient. However, avoid over-fertilizing, as this can encourage taller growth at the expense of spreading.\n\n6. **Weeding**: Keep the area around the plant free of weeds. Weeds compete with the fringed willowherb for resources, so maintaining a clear area around the plant can help it thrive in its intended role.\n\n7. **Transplanting**: If the plant is still growing taller than desired and is becoming an unwanted intruder in other areas of the garden, consider transplanting it to a location where it can be allowed to grow taller and more freely.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can manage the growth of the fringed willowherb and ensure it functions effectively as a ground cover.",

                "answer": "The image shows a coniferous tree, likely an Arborvitae, with some areas of the foliage appearing reddish or discolored. This discoloration could be indicative of several potential issues such as nutrient deficiencies, pest infestations, or environmental stressors like drought or excessive moisture.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**:\n   - **Nutrient Deficiency**: If the discoloration is due to a nutrient deficiency, soil testing can help determine which nutrients are lacking. Adding the appropriate fertilizers (e.g., iron, manganese) can correct the issue.\n   - **Pest Infestation**: Look for signs of pests such as aphids, mites, or borers. If pests are present, identify the species and apply suitable pesticides or biological control methods.\n   - **Environmental Stress**: Check the plant\u2019s surroundings for signs of stress, such as waterlogged soil or excessive sun exposure. Adjust watering and shading practices accordingly.\n\n2. **Pruning**:\n   - Prune off any dead or diseased branches to promote healthy growth and reduce the spread of disease.\n\n3. **Water Management**:\n   - Ensure consistent but adequate watering. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering can cause stress that manifests in discolored foliage.\n\n4. **Fertilization**:\n   - Apply a balanced fertilizer designed for conifers to ensure all essential nutrients are available. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions regarding application rates and frequency.\n\n5. **Regular Maintenance**:\n   - Regularly inspect the tree for signs of new problems and maintain good sanitation by removing any debris around the base of the tree.\n\n6. **Consultation**:\n   - If the issue persists after implementing these steps, it may be beneficial to consult a horticulturist or arborist who can provide more specific advice based on the local climate and conditions.\n\nBy addressing the potential causes of the discoloration promptly and systematically, you can help the Arborvitae recover and maintain its health.",

                "answer": "The image shows a Pacific Madrone (Arbutus menziesii) with signs of distress, such as drooping leaves and what appears to be a heavy burden of small flowers or fruits that could be causing the plant stress. Here are some potential management strategies that could help address the health issues observed:\n\n1. **Pruning**: To relieve the plant of excess weight and improve air circulation, it may be necessary to prune off some of the heavy flower clusters and dead branches. This can help reduce the load on the plant and encourage healthier growth.\n\n2. **Watering and Fertilization**: Ensure the plant receives adequate moisture during dry periods and that it is not overwatered. A balanced fertilizer can provide essential nutrients, but it should be applied carefully to avoid over-fertilization which can also harm the plant.\n\n3. **Disease Management**: Inspect the plant for any signs of disease or pests. If fungal diseases are suspected, fungicides might be needed. Regular monitoring and timely treatment can prevent further damage.\n\n4. **Supportive Care**: If the plant appears weakened due to the heavy fruit load, consider providing support or staking to help stabilize the branches if they are leaning or breaking under the weight.\n\n5. **Consultation**: Given the specific location and time of year, consulting with a local horticulturist or arborist would be beneficial. They can provide more tailored advice based on the regional conditions and the specific needs of the Pacific Madrone.\n\n6. **Pollination Management**: In some cases, heavy fruit loads can lead to reduced flowering in the following years. If the current issue is primarily due to overproduction, managing pollination by hand or using pollinators like bees could be considered, though this is generally not a common practice and should only be done under expert guidance.\n\n7. **Environmental Adaptation**: Consider the local climate and environmental conditions. If the area experiences frequent droughts or extreme weather events, ensuring the plant is well-adapted to these conditions might be necessary.\n\nImplementing these strategies requires careful observation and attention to detail. Monitoring the plant's response to these measures will help determine their effectiveness and whether additional actions are needed.",

                "answer": "The plant in the image appears to be Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), which is known for its rapid multiplication and persistence despite various treatments. Here are some recommended management strategies for controlling Canada thistle:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: As mentioned in the background information, manual removal is effective. Digging up the roots completely is crucial because Canada thistle can regrow from root fragments left behind. Ensure that all roots are removed to prevent new plants from sprouting.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices**: Regularly mowing the area can help reduce the establishment of new thistles by keeping the ground surface free of debris and reducing the chances of seed germination. Avoid compacting the soil, as this can promote root growth.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Herbicides**: Use selective herbicides specifically targeted at broadleaf weeds like Canada thistle. Products such as 2,4-D, dicamba, or triclopyr can be effective when applied correctly. Always read and follow the label instructions carefully, as these chemicals can be harmful if not used properly.\n   - **Pre-emergent Herbicides**: Applying pre-emergent herbicides like atrazine or pendimethalin can prevent seeds from germinating before they reach the soil surface. These should be applied early in the growing season, usually in the fall or spring.\n\n4. **Biological Control**: While less common, biological control using specific insects or pathogens that target Canada thistle can be an option. However, this method is typically more applicable in large-scale agricultural settings and may not be feasible on a smaller scale.\n\n5. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Combine different methods to manage Canada thistle effectively. This includes a mix of physical, chemical, and possibly cultural controls tailored to the specific environment and conditions.\n\n6. **Monitor and Repeat Treatments**: Canada thistle is persistent, and it may take multiple rounds of treatment over several years to fully eradicate it. Regular monitoring and prompt action to remove any new growth are essential.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can better manage the spread and persistence of Canada thistle in your garden or landscaped area.",

                "response": "Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert.  <br>Your picture suggests earwigs.  You cannot find them because they come out at night, eat and then crawl into small spaces to spend the day.  They are out in record numbers from what I hear from other gardeners in the area and in my own garden and containers.  They eat most anything.  <br>However, hops have a number of pests and diseases that plague the plant.  I have added a link from Washington State University - quite a long book but if you look at page 47 and view the rest of the book you will find the pests with lots of pictures and then the predators (the good guys).\u00a0 Look carefully at the good guys as larvae, they often will eat twice or more times as much as the adult insect.\u00a0<br>I recommend putting out tuna cans or small cat food cans on the ground near the hops, minus most of the tuna filled with a vegetable oil about 1/4 inch full.  Use small amounts of the juice or oil from the tuna with a tiny piece of tuna in the can.\u00a0 Most any canned seafood works though.\u00a0 The bugs will crawl in and drown.<br> Put them out in the evening and if you have pets, pick them up before they go outside in the morning.  They love the contents and you will not be able to see what crawled in during the night.  Could also be slugs, but I do not see any slime trails. Another possibility is Japanese beetles but I have not heard any mention of them outside Portland.  That, of course, does not mean they could not be out there.\u00a0 If you find earwigs, make sure you put the cans out every night, until you no longer are seeing any bugs in the oil.\u00a0 If it fills up, dump the batch and make a new one. <br>If you do decide to use a pesticide, look for bottles that have 'OMRI approved' on them.\u00a0 These pesticides are usually less toxic, however, the tuna can idea is proven.\u00a0 I have gathered about 50 earwigs in various areas of the garden in one night. If you have fruit trees they will crawl up and usually eat into the fruit near the stem - when ripe.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Another preventative measure is to put a cardboard ring around the base of the hops, depending on how many plants you have this may take a lot of time.\u00a0 I use cardboard, cut about 5 inches wide.\u00a0 Dig a small trench around the base in the soil and make a connected circle with the cardboard.\u00a0 Paint the cardboard with petroleum jelly or you can buy a produce called Tanglefoot and put that one.\u00a0 Wear gloves, Tanglefoot is really sticky.\u00a0 Put the jelly on thick about one-two inches down from the top on both sides (just in case they are inside the circle).\u00a0 This will prevent any bugs from crawlng up the stalk to the leaves from outside the ring.\u00a0 This is a great preventative measure for ants that 'herd' aphids.\u00a0 Ants protect aphids from predators.\u00a0<br>Since your picture shows a fence, I would check little cracks where one piece of wood may cover another.\u00a0 Knock the wood to jar the bugs to the ground or use spinosad insecticide to spray them.\u00a0 This is toxic to all insects but you must actually spray them to kill them. \u00a0So you can avoid killing the pollinators.<br>Please feel free to recontact us if you have further questions. \u00a0  <br><a href=\"http://msue.anr.msu.edu/uploads/234/71503/Hop_Field_Guide_Third_Edition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msue.anr.msu.edu/uploads/234/71503/Hop_Field_Guide_Third_Edition.pdf</a>\u00a0<br><br><br>\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>",

I suspect the plants are seriously stressed due to receiving too little water -- that is, the roots are dry. (I also see that the Hebe shrubs look stressed, too; the reason is probably the same.)  Both require  average moisture whereas their companions -- the festuca grass and viburnum shrubs -- thrive with less.<br>Each time you irrigate, probe the soil with a trowel. For both the star jasmine and the hebe, the soil should be uniformly moist to 8 to 10 inches. Ten minutes won't accomplish that because the leafy top sheds the water/rain.<br>I also wonder about the\u00a0 overhead for the sitting area. Is far enough to the side that it sheds rainfall, too?<br>Anyway, the bottom line is to verify how how moist the soil is and for how long. You might need to water deeply just once ever 3 weeks during the warm months. But keep that trowel at the ready -- check the soil now and then.<br>\n<br>P.S.

        "question": "This yr I learned to maximize flavor that figs should not be picked until quite soft.  The downside of this is if a day late, the European hornets are on them, and then a cpl wks ago this beetle has arrived.  Some figs have them completely covering the surface.  They look like bark beetles but since aren't on the bark I assume not.  There are some faint goldish/copperish markings on the rear section that did not show clearly in the pics.  Can you identify and advise if any other damage is likely and if any measures are warranted.  Thanks",

It is reported to feed on tree sap and a wide variety of flowers and fruits. Its grubs feed on roots and organic detritus in soil.</p><p>You could try covering the figs you are waiting to harvest\u00a0with mesh bags (like small cinchable organza bags used for party favors) to keep the larger insects at bay, though we don't know if wasps or beetles would try to chew through them. Granted, on shrubs with lots of fruits, this would be tedious, plus\u00a0difficult to do if the wasps have already found them. (Perhaps wait for a rainy day when the insects are less likely to be foraging. Or, next year, try enclosing the entire plant with a netting-covered cage, since you don't need to worry about excluding pollinators with figs.)\u00a0No sprays are recommended, nor would they likely be very effective. Unfortunately we don't have any other suggestions for how to keep them repelled while not resorting to\u00a0coating the fruits with something unpalatable or hard to wash off.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Miri</p>",

        "question": "Hello! We moved into a house several years ago that has a lovely old grapevine in the backyard. I've been told they're Concord grapes, but I'm not sure. Every spring, the leaves come in lush, and the grapes begin to sprout. But early-mid summer the leaves start to show a lacy deterioration and the grapes shrivel and turn black and dry before ever maturing. I'm attaching a picture of the leaves &amp; can send a picture of the grapes, too, if that's helpful. Is there anything we can do? Thank you so much!",

            "1": {
                "response": "The tattered leaves are an insect problem. It could be several insects, but that low level of damage does not bring any specific insect to mind. Either way I do not believe that this leaf feeding is important in your situation. You also described the fruit turning black and shriveling up. This sounds like black rot. The best control for you is a fungicide spray at bloom, another 10-14 days later, and a third 10 to 14 days after that. The berries become resistant to the disease about 4 weeks after bloom. Captan is a common homeowner fungicide and you should be able to get it or a mixture of it and an insecticide at a big box store or your local garden store.Here is a link to grape insects and diseases in New York<a href=\"http://nysipm.cornell.edu/factsheets/grapes/\" target=\"\" rel=\"\">http://nysipm.cornell.edu/factsheets/grapes/</a><br>",

It seems to grow in a mat under low-lying landscaping, but is also poking up through some flowering bushes along the front porch. The most distinctive feature that I have identified is that it seems to have well defined joints and segments. When I have tried manually pulling the weeds out, they like to separate easily at the joints without much pulling effort and I never seem to be able to find where they originate in order to pull out the roots. They also seem to have some small flowering buds on the segments and the leaves appear in sets of 2, usually at the joints in the segments. The leaves are small and oval-ish in shape, but do come to a slight point. I have included some pictures with the hope that someone can help me identify this plant and provide some tips on how to remove it and keep it from coming back. I can try to provide more detailed pictures if need be. I will admit, that the landscaped beds are probably due for a re-mulching soon so maybe that will help overall, but any other suggestions in the meantime would be welcome.",

                "answer": "The plant in the image appears to be chickweed, which is a common weed that can proliferate quickly in disturbed soil or areas with rich organic matter, such as those that might have been affected by recent landscaping activities.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**:\n   - **Manual Weeding**: Regularly pull out chickweed by hand, ensuring you remove the entire root system to prevent regrowth. This method is effective but requires ongoing effort.\n   - **Gloves**: Consider wearing gloves to protect your hands from the irritating sap.\n\n2. **Mulching**:\n   - **Re-mulch**: As mentioned in the background information, it's likely that the landscaped beds need a fresh layer of mulch. Mulch helps suppress weed growth by reducing sunlight exposure and competition for nutrients and water.\n   - **Organic Mulches**: Use materials like wood chips, shredded leaves, or straw, which can help break down and improve the soil over time.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Pre-emergent Herbicides**: Apply pre-emergent herbicides if you prefer not to physically remove weeds. These chemicals interfere with the development of new weeds, preventing them from growing.\n   - **Post-emergent Herbicides**: If chickweed has already germinated, post-emergent herbicides can be used. However, be cautious with herbicides around plants and consider their effectiveness on other desirable plants.\n   - **Read Labels Carefully**: Always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on rates, application times, and safety measures when using any herbicide.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Watering Practices**: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep-rooted plants that are less susceptible to weed invasion.\n   - **Soil Health**: Maintain healthy soil through regular testing and application of necessary nutrients and amendments. Healthy soil can better compete with weeds for resources.\n   - **Regular Maintenance**: Keep the landscape beds well-maintained to reduce opportunities for weeds to establish.\n\n5. **Biological Control**:\n   - **Beneficial Insects**: Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and nematodes, which can help control the population of chickweed naturally.\n\nBy combining these methods, you can effectively manage the chickweed proliferation in your landscaped areas and maintain a more desirable aesthetic. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be key to keeping your newly landscaped property looking its best.",

The fungus Colletotrichum can attack both leaves\nand blooms in the lower and upper part of bigleaf hydrangea plant canopy.\nDevelopment of this disease is favorable in wet weather conditions. Heavily\nfertilized hydrangea may become more susceptible to anthracnose disease. First\nsymptoms of this disease are the circular or slightly irregular brown spots\nforming on the leaves. The center of these brown spots turns to tan in color.\nSometimes larger spots appear on border mid vein or other major veins in the\nleaf and they become clearly more angular in shape. When anthracnose developed\nunder favorable environmental conditions, large, dark brown, irregular spots\ncan spread across the whole leaves and flower petals. Several continuous days\nof wet conditions can produce masses of spores, which can be embedded in\nhydrangea leaf debris. Spores may spread by splashing water to the leaves and\nbloom clusters. Repeated showers, dew, and lengthened periods of heavy fog can\nspeed up the rate of infection and the appearance of symptoms. The main source\nof anthracnose inoculum is the infected hydrangea. The following options are\navailable for managing anthracnose on hydrangea such as taking cuttings from\nhealthy plants; collecting fallen diseased leaves and removing blighted blooms\nfrom landscape plantings.

They usually lose bark because of freezing and thawing action in winter when exposed to full sun and also hitting with mowers and weed trimmers when young.  Both of these increase borer damage into the trunk leading to further bark loss.  There is really not much to do for a tree in this condition.  Killing grass and weeds for several feet around the tree and mulching about 2-3 inches deep is helpful.  Spraying with permethrin in May each year (lower trunk only) to prevent further borer damage may help.  Water when under drought stress is always a good idea in the heat of the summer.  Do not fertilze very much (3 pound 10-10-10 each May is enough).  ",

Given the context provided, these plants are likely the species *Campanula*, which can be invasive and difficult to manage if left unchecked. Here\u2019s a recommended management strategy for controlling the spread of *Campanula*:\n\n1. **Mechanical Removal**: Manually dig out the plants, being thorough to remove as much of the root system as possible. This should be done regularly, especially during the spring when the plants are actively growing.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**: Use selective herbicides such as glyphosate or 2,4-D to target the *Campanula* without harming the surrounding grass. Be sure to follow the label instructions carefully, as applying the wrong concentration could damage the plants you want to keep.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Regular mowing can help prevent the spread of *Campanula* by keeping it from producing seeds. Also, ensure good soil health and water management practices to maintain a competitive environment for desired grasses over the invasive plants.\n\n4. **Biological Control**: In some cases, biological control agents (e.g., insects or fungi) specific to the *Campanula* can be introduced, but this method requires careful study and approval from local authorities due to potential ecological impacts.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the area for signs of *Campanula* re-establishment or new growth and treat promptly. Invasive species can become established quickly, so regular checks are essential.\n\n6. **Preventative Measures**: If the *Campanula* has already spread extensively, consider creating physical barriers like mulch or landscape fabric to prevent further spread until the plants can be removed completely.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage the spread of *Campanula* in your Ramsey County, Minnesota lawn and garden.",

When we had drought conditions for several years (five years ago), the tops of the rhododendrons started to die off. I've trimmed dead sections, but they still are slowly dying off. Now it appears I might lose several of these 15 ft tall bushes. I'm guessing these are probably 30 years old. A large part of the main trunk, near the base has split in several areas. See the photos of the splits/spotted leaves that are curling and dropping off. I'm guessing the cold wet winter finally killed the oldest one because the rain got into the split trunk, froze, expanded and killed the bush? Please, tell me what the spotted leaves mean. Is it a disease, or a condition I can correct? I do rake away the dead leaves and replace with seasoned bark mulch. I also fertilize lightly with miracle gro maybe twice a season.

Given the background information provided, here's a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Monitor for Pest and Disease:** Check the affected areas for signs of pests like leaf miners or scale insects, which can be common in rhododendrons after droughts. If infestation is severe, consider using organic pesticides such as neem oil or insecticidal soap.\n\n2. **Watering:** Ensure that the rhododendrons receive adequate moisture, especially during dry periods. Mulching around the base of the plants can help retain soil moisture. Consider installing a drip irrigation system if the area experiences prolonged dry spells.\n\n3. **Fertilization:** Continue to fertilize lightly with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer suitable for acid-loving plants. Avoid over-fertilizing as this can lead to nutrient imbalances and root issues.\n\n4. **Pruning:** Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth. This will also help prevent the spread of diseases. Prune back to healthy wood, ensuring that you do not remove more than one-third of the plant at any time.\n\n5. **Supportive Care:** Keep an eye on the rhododendrons for any further signs of stress or disease. Regularly check for signs of recovery, and adjust your care practices accordingly.\n\n6. **Seasonal Maintenance:** Continue the seasonal practice of trimming dead sections, raking away dead leaves, and applying seasoned bark mulch as these steps can help reduce the risk of disease and improve overall plant health.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to support the recovery and ongoing health of your rhododendrons. If the problem persists, it may be beneficial to consult with a local horticulturist or gardening professional who can provide more specific advice based on the local climate and soil conditions.",

        "question": "We found some spots in our yard where the grass looked blackened - the best way I can describe it is that it looked like someone had cleaned up dog poo from the yard, and it had left a mark. After that we found a few areas with slimy yellow splotches--at this point we thought an animal had vomited in our yard. The next morning we woke up to 4-5 large yellow patches that started slimy looking and throughout the day have browned a bit and now have almost a cauliflower texture. We assume the blackened spots we first found were areas where this had already occurred then burned away. \u00a0The affected areas are in distinctly different areas, although now that I think about it they are all on the parking strips (front and side) and seem to be near trees (that may or may not mean much, as we have trees lining our parking strip, however they do seem to be close to the trees--in fact one of the patches is on the woodchips surrounding a tree). I am surprised at how quickly this has appeared, as the patches are quite large (6-12 inch diameters)<br>The attached photos include: one of the blackened spots, then 2 pictures of the same yellow patch, one taken in the morning, the next in the afternoon (the more brownish one was the afternoon shot, they appear below in reverse order)",

                "answer": "The image shows sweet potato vines with leaves that appear to be wilting, turning yellow, and some with brown spots or necrosis, particularly around the edges. This condition could be indicative of several issues such as nutrient deficiency, water stress, overwatering, disease, or pests. Given the background information that the plants are watered daily in a sunny location, it's important to rule out overwatering as a primary cause.\n\nHere\u2019s a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Assess Watering**: Check if the soil is consistently moist but not overly wet. Overwatering can lead to root rot and wilting. Ensure the plants have proper drainage and consider adjusting watering frequency if necessary.\n\n2. **Soil Inspection**: Gently dig into the soil near the base of the plant to check for root health. Healthy roots should be firm and white or light tan. Root rot might be indicated by soft, slimy roots or discoloration.\n\n3. **Nutrient Analysis**: Test the soil to determine if there is a nutrient deficiency. Sweet potato vines require consistent levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Applying a balanced fertilizer tailored to their needs may help.\n\n4. **Pest Control**: Inspect the plants for any signs of pests. Look for aphids, spider mites, or other insects that can cause leaf damage. If pests are present, treat them with an appropriate insecticide.\n\n5. **Leaf Diseases**: If leaf diseases are suspected, collect a sample of affected leaves and take them to a local extension office or garden center for diagnosis. Based on the results, apply the appropriate fungicide or other treatments.\n\n6. **Sunlight and Airflow**: Ensure the plants are receiving adequate sunlight and good airflow. Poor air circulation can contribute to disease development. Prune dead or infected leaves to improve air circulation.\n\n7. **Rotation and Maintenance**: Avoid planting sweet potato vines in the same spot year after year to reduce the risk of soil-borne pathogens. Maintain healthy soil practices and avoid overcrowding plants to ensure they have enough space to grow and thrive.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you can help manage the current issue and promote healthier growth of your sweet potato vines.",

Does the soil dry out and get enough light (most vegetables need full sun)\u00a0and air to grow your vegetables there?<br /> <br /> It can be a difficult weed to control. Just scraping or pulling will likely just break off and leave roots. You could try digging and sifting out all of the plant parts that you can, but only try that when the soil has dried since digging in wet soil is never recommended as it can damage the soil structure.<br /> <br /> They grow from a type of root system called a rhizome, which can send out 'stems'\u00a0horizontally which makes smothering difficult.<br /> We don't know if it will work, but if you try smothering again, do it for a long time.<br /> <br /> Christine<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pond-pest-management\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pond-pest-management</a>",

Interspersed among the greenery are dry, brown leaves and twigs, indicating a natural setting that may have experienced seasonal changes.\n\nOverlying the plants is a black grid-like structure, which appears to be a type of plastic mesh commonly used as weed control fabric in gardens. This mesh is likely being used to suppress weeds while allowing the desired plants to grow through it. The surrounding soil looks moist, possibly due to recent rainfall or irrigation.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a garden or landscaped area that is currently in a state of growth and maintenance.

                "answer": "The image shows a young serviceberry tree with signs of stress or potential disease. The bark appears to have discoloration, which could be indicative of various issues such as sunburn, mechanical damage, or fungal infections. Given the context that the trees were planted recently and are experiencing extreme heat and drought conditions, it's important to address these issues promptly.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Watering**: Since the trees are on a drip irrigation system, ensure that they receive adequate water. Despite being on a schedule, check the soil moisture regularly to see if additional watering is needed. The frequency and duration of the drip system might need adjustment based on local conditions and soil type.\n\n2. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture and moderate soil temperature. Ensure the mulch does not touch the trunk to prevent potential rot.\n\n3. **Pruning**: Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth and reduce the risk of infection. This can help the tree focus its energy on remaining healthy parts.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Consider fertilizing the tree with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer suitable for young trees. This will provide necessary nutrients to support growth during stressful conditions.\n\n5. **Sun Protection**: If the tree is suffering from sunburn, consider using a temporary shade cloth or painting the trunk with white latex paint to reflect sunlight and reduce the risk of further damage.\n\n6. **Monitor for Diseases**: Keep an eye out for signs of disease, such as additional discoloration, deformities, or the presence of pests. Early detection and treatment can prevent the spread of diseases.\n\n7. **Consult a Professional**: If the issue persists or worsens, consult with a local arborist or horticulturist who can provide more specific advice tailored to the local conditions and species.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help the serviceberry tree recover from the stress of heat and drought while promoting healthy growth.",

We do not see any signs of pests or disease on the photos. Wood-boring insects and infections of the vascular tissue (sapwood, just under the bark) can cause sap oozing on other outdoor trees, but it would be highly unlikely in an enclosed indoor environment such as the room they are pictured in.<br><br>Miri",

As noted in the linked page, exclusion from the crop is the simplest and most effective approach to managing them, where row cover is used to block access so plants are shielded immediately after planting. For now, just pluck off and squish those you can catch (or drop them into a pan of soapy water to drown) and remove all plant debris once you're done harvesting the plants (even if that's in spring) so it doesn't harbor pests or disease spores for the next planting.<br /> <br /> Miri",

                "response": "<p>Maples are thin-barked trees, making them susceptible to frost\ncrack. Was this tree wrapped the first several years during the winter? This\nmay be the reason for the crack you noted may have been there several years. It\nis highly recommended that young (the first 4 years), thin-barked trees be\nwrapped November to April which helps insulate the bark from temperature\nfluctuations. Warm temperatures during the winter will bring the tree trunk out\nof dormancy, only to have temperatures drop resulting in the freezing of cells\nand tissue causing severe cracks. \u00a0</p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As far as recent cracks on a more mature tree, there is no\nsingle reason for bark splitting on trees. This crack may have started from a\nwound inflicted earlier in the tree's development. Sometimes a crack may remain\nin the internal wood, but growth or other factors can cause the crack to expand\nand split the bark. Fluctuating growth conditions also cause splitting of bark.\nHot, dry weather (which slows growth) followed by wet or ideal growth\nconditions (such as cool and rainy June) may cause a growth spurt leading to\nsplits in the bark.</p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Little can be done to help the tree deal with this type of\ninjury. A healthy tree will form what is called \u201cwound wood\u201d, which is\nessentially a callus that forms over the injury. Healthy trees callus over\nquickly. Encourage health by fertilizing (if needed) in the spring, proper\npruning and adequate irrigation in hot, dry weather. Do not fertilize in the fall,\nas that encourages new growth which is more susceptible to splitting. Do not\nremove the bark around the crack or attempt to paint or treat the damaged area.\nBark splits generally close over completely leaving a slight ridge in the trunk\nwhere callus tissue has been produced.</p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As the tree grows, the bark becomes darker and becomes slightly\nraised with long, flared plates with ridges. The appearance will likely vary in\ncolor with brown, gray, or near black, often with an orange interior bark.</p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one notation on this tree. It appears that it was\nplanted incorrectly which has caused what is known as \u2018girdling roots\u2019 which\nare roots that emerge at or slightly below the soil surface. Girdling roots cut\ninto at least one side of the main trunk, essentially choking the tree and\npreventing movement of water and nutrients. This tree may start to show symptoms\nof decline at some point because of this. See the photo attached notating the\ngirdling roots.</p><p><br></p><p></p>",

If so, it is probably not a pest as the text in your photo indicates. <br><br>On the other hand, if there are small hard bumps in scattered places on the leaves, your plant may have scale insects which are a common pest of ficus. It is important to determine what the bumps are in order to determine what remedy, if any, is required. <br><br>If you believe your tree has scale, here are the comments from one of the Extension universities:<br><p>\"Contact chemicals are most effective when used to treat the juvenile (crawler) form of the insect before they have formed their protective covering. At this time horticultural oil and insecticidal soaps are very effective. (Both have very low toxicity...) These products can stain fabrics, so cover carpets, upholstery, and draperies if you apply these (or any other product indoors).\u00a0</p><p>Some authors recommend the use of systemic insecticides to kill the adult phase of this insect. Contact insecticides [mentioned above] are ineffective because of the scales protective covering, but systemic insecticides are absorbed into the plant and then into the insect when it feeds on the plant juices. These products are more toxic to us and our pets, so it is safest to apply them outside and leave the plant in a shady location until the chemical has dried.</p><p>Mechanical control [involves dipping] a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol and rub firmly enough to remove the insect (covering and all) from the stems and leaves. Some scale insects will rub off quite easily while others will require more effort. Take care not to bruise the plant when doing this.</p><p>Plants that are severely infested with insects may be treated (mechanically or chemically) so that their problems will not spread to other plants, or they may be discarded and replaced with healthy plants from a nursery. Problems are more easily treated now rather than in the middle of the winter when it is too cold to take houseplants outside for treatment.\"</p>",

                "response": "Hello again, <br><br>I came across some additional information on identifying scale insects that you may find useful:<br><br>\"Most scale insects are very small, usually ranging in size from 1/16 to 1/8 inch long. However, you will never see just one of them, which makes them hard to miss. Scale almost always appears in clusters. Unlike other insects, they are immobile once they lock themselves into place to pierce the plant and begin feeding on sap. If you see clusters of tiny shell-like bumps on the stems or leaves of a plant, there is a good chance you are looking at a scale.<p>Scale insects are usually divided into two groups:\u00a0soft scale, and hard or armored scale. Soft scale is covered with a protective waxy substance and is somewhat easier to kill than hard/armored scale.2 Armored scale secretes a hard shell over its body for protection from predators. The shell also makes it difficult to use a pesticide because it has trouble reaching the insect inside.\"</p>",

                "answer": "The image shows garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), a non-native invasive species that can outcompete native plants in shaded woodland areas. Garlic mustard is particularly problematic because it spreads quickly and can disrupt the ecosystem by reducing biodiversity.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Manual Removal**:\n   - **When**: During the growing season, typically in spring before the plants produce seed pods.\n   - **How**: Hand pull the plants, making sure to remove the roots completely. Dispose of the plants in a sealed bag to prevent them from spreading seeds.\n   - **Note**: It's important to remove the entire plant, including the root, as even small pieces can regenerate into new plants.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **When**: If manual removal is impractical or the infestation is extensive.\n   - **How**: Use systemic herbicides specifically labeled for garlic mustard, such as triclopyr. Follow the label instructions carefully.\n   - **Note**: Apply herbicides during the growing season when the plants are actively growing. Be cautious with chemical application to avoid harming native plants or other wildlife.\n\n3. **Biological Control**:\n   - **When**: Not applicable in this scenario unless specific biological controls are available and approved for the area.\n   - **How**: Some regions have introduced biocontrol agents like the garlic mustard weevil (Liriomyza alliariae) which feeds on garlic mustard but does not harm native plants. However, this method requires careful monitoring and approval from local authorities.\n\n4. **Preventive Measures**:\n   - **Seed Collection**: If you notice garlic mustard seedlings, collect the seeds and dispose of them properly to prevent new growth.\n   - **Raising Awareness**: Educate others about the importance of managing garlic mustard to prevent its spread. This includes teaching people how to identify it and how to remove it correctly.\n\n5. **Restoration of Native Plants**:\n   - **After Control**: Once the garlic mustard is controlled, it\u2019s important to restore the area with native plants. This helps to re-establish the ecological balance and support biodiversity.\n\n### Safety Precautions:\n- Always wear protective gear (gloves, long sleeves) when handling garlic mustard.\n- Be aware of the potential health risks associated with certain herbicides. Wear appropriate safety equipment and follow all label instructions.\n- Dispose of treated plants and debris responsibly to prevent contamination.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage the garlic mustard invasion in your wooded area, helping to preserve",

                "answer": "The image shows a label for a \"No Mow Fine Fescue Mixture,\" which suggests that it is a seed mix designed to be low-maintenance and suitable for areas where mowing is not desired. The issue described in the background information involves an overgrowth of undesired grass on a septic mound in Nicollet County, Minnesota.\n\nGiven the composition of the mixture (which includes various types of fescue grass), it seems that the mixture might be suitable for maintaining a dense, low-growing ground cover. However, if the undesired grass is outcompeting the fescue species, a more targeted approach might be needed.\n\nHere are some potential management strategies:\n\n1. **Chemical Control**: Apply a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds while sparing the fescue. Be cautious with herbicides near septic systems to avoid contamination.\n\n2. **Mechanical Removal**: Regularly hand-pull or use a small trowel to remove the undesired grasses. This can help reduce competition and allow the fescue to regrow.\n\n3. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the septic mound to suppress weed growth. This can help create a more favorable environment for the fescue to thrive.\n\n4. **Fertilization and Watering**: Ensure that the fescue receives adequate nutrients and water. This can sometimes help it outcompete other grasses.\n\n5. **Cultural Practices**: Mow the area regularly to keep the grass short and dense, which can help reduce the growth of weeds. Even though the mix is labeled as no-mow, regular trimming might still be necessary to manage the spread of undesirable plants.\n\n6. **Re-seeding**: If the problem persists, consider re-seeding the area with a higher percentage of fescue or a mix that better suits the local conditions and climate.\n\nIt's important to consult with a professional, such as a landscape or agricultural expert, before applying any treatments, especially when dealing with septic systems. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and ensure that any treatment does not cause harm to the septic system or the surrounding environment.",

At night I place bug zapper lights out and in the morning I have a circle of dead bugs around the lights. I would say a couple hundred every night. Sometimes in the atrium there is a swarm of them flying around in a ball about 15 feet in the air. I put extensions on my hose and suck them up, but no matter what I do I cant get rid of them. It just seems like I can get the numbers down to a smaller amount, but they always come back. They seem to be attracted to people.

Given the context provided, the presence of a koi pond and plants in an atrium, as well as the frequent bombing of the office by pests, suggests a significant infestation problem.\n\nHere\u2019s a recommended management strategy for addressing the midge infestation:\n\n### Habitat Modification\n1. **Pond Management**: Since the koi pond is a potential breeding ground for midges, it's crucial to maintain it properly.\n   - **Regular Cleaning**: Ensure that the pond is cleaned every two months as mentioned, and remove any organic debris, leaves, or decaying plant matter that can serve as breeding sites.\n   - **Water Circulation**: Use aerators or fountains to keep the water moving, which can help reduce mosquito larvae and prevent midges from laying eggs in still water.\n\n### Physical Control\n2. **Bug Zapper Lights**: Continue using bug zapper lights to trap adult midges, especially at night when they are most active.\n3. **Insect Nets**: If possible, cover the koi pond with insect nets to physically block midges from entering and laying eggs.\n\n### Chemical Control\n4. **Insecticides**: Although pest control services are already in place, consider additional targeted treatments for midges if the infestation persists.\n   - **Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti)**: This biological insecticide is effective against mosquito larvae and can be applied directly to the pond water without harming beneficial insects.\n   - **Fogging**: For more localized areas within the office, fogging with approved insecticides may be necessary, but always follow safety guidelines and use them according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)\n5. **IPM Approach**: Combine all the above methods into an integrated approach to manage the midge population effectively. Monitor the situation regularly and adjust your strategies based on feedback.\n\n### Prevention\n6. **Avoid Attracting Midge Adults**:\n   - **Proper Waste Disposal**: Keep trash and food scraps away from the pond area.\n   - **Sealing Off Entry Points**: Ensure that there are no openings in the walls or windows where midges can enter the office.\n   - **Plants and Decor**: Keep plants and decorations away from the pond edge to avoid attracting midges.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the midge population in your environment, making the office a",

Young trees with thin bark are most susceptible to sunscald injury. The injury occurs when exposed bark on the tree warms up on sunny days and previously dormant cells within the plant become active in response to the warmth. Research has shown that the south side of a tree can be as much as 77\u00b0F warmer on a cold winter day than the north side of the tree. The newly activated cells lose some of their cold-hardiness and are injured when temperatures drop below freezing during the nighttime hours. Resulting damage includes discoloration and cracking of the bark. The portions of trunks and branches facing south and southwest warm the most because they get the most direct sun and because they get sun later in the day when air temperatures are warmest.\"<br /> <br /> I am also including some more information from Colorado State University.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/weeds-cultural-problems/2111-sunscald-trees/\">https://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/weeds-cultural-problems/2111-sunscald-trees/</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/environmental-disorders-of-woody-plants-2-932/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/environmental-disorders-of-woody-plants-2-932/</a><br /> <br /> Please see the information below\u00a0about how to water trees during a drought.\u00a0 Drought stressed trees are more susceptible to sunscald.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/watering-a-home-landscape-during-drought-7-240-2/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/watering-a-home-landscape-during-drought-7-240-2/</a><br /> <br /> A newly planted tree has some additional irrigation needs\u00a0 in order to successfully establish its root system.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://cmg.extension.colostate.edu/Gardennotes/635.pdf\">https://cmg.extension.colostate.edu/Gardennotes/635.pdf</a>",

This condition is not unusual and can occur due to several factors, including natural aging, environmental stress, or disease. However, since the tree appears to be otherwise healthy, it's likely that the peeling bark is not a serious concern.\n\nHere are some management strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the tree for any signs of decline or changes in the bark condition over time. If the peeling continues or becomes more severe, it could indicate a problem that requires further attention.\n\n2. **Inspect for Other Issues**: Check the rest of the tree for signs of disease or pests. While the bark peeling itself may not be a major issue, there could be underlying problems that affect the health of the tree.\n\n3. **Prune if Necessary**: If there are dead or diseased branches near the peeling area, these should be pruned to prevent the spread of disease and to maintain the structure of the tree.\n\n4. **Watering**: Ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry periods. Chinkapin oaks prefer well-drained soil and can benefit from consistent moisture.\n\n5. **Mulch**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Be sure not to pile mulch too close to the trunk, as this can lead to issues like stem girdling or fungal infections.\n\n6. **Avoid Damage**: Protect the tree from physical damage caused by lawn mowers, string trimmers, or other equipment. These activities can harm the bark and potentially weaken the tree.\n\nIf the peeling bark persists or worsens, or if you notice other symptoms such as leaf drop, discoloration, or dieback, consult with a local arborist or horticulturist for a professional assessment. They can provide specific recommendations based on the tree\u2019s overall health and the conditions of the bark peeling.",

Control of such insects is unnecessary; however, if you consider the webbing to be unsightly, you could use a high-pressure stream of water to remove it from the trees.<br><br>Here are some links with more information:<br><a href=\"http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/plant_problems/hgic2365.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/plant_problems/hgic2365.html</a><br><br><a href=\"http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/galveston/beneficials/beneficial-41_barklice2_Cerastipscus_sp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/galveston/beneficials/beneficial-41_barklice2_Cerastipscus_sp.htm</a><br><br>Thanks for the question.<br><br>",

The leaf shape is similar to a smilax species, but I am not sure on an id for the vine. You should be fine cutting it down to ground level and/or pulling what roots and vines you can. That would definitely be my recommended first course of action. An if that doesn't work we can always move on to more extreme measures. If it is a relatively new plant though i think pulling/cutting it should damage it enough to keep it from returning. Especially with the drought we've been experiencing.\u00a0However, without being able to get a good id on the plant I hesitate to say with certainty that it will work. If you could provide me with some close up pictures of the stems and leaves I may be able to give a more direct answer to your question.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0I hope this helps some. An if you are able to get more pictures of the vine. I would gladly look into it further for you. If you have any other questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me or the extension.

It is common for some weeds to germinate with a new lawn, however this looks like more of an extreme case.  Typically you should be able to wait until the lawn is more established (after about 6 weeks) and then use an herbicide for broadleaf weeds for lawns.  However, I am worried in some areas that the weeds may out compete the grass and you may not end up with a good stand of grass.  In the worst spots you may need to spray out the weeds and reseed.  I would recommend bringing in some of the weeds into the local extension office to have them identified, especially for the sections of lawn with more scattered weeds, that way if you use an herbicide for this weed as your lawn is more established you can be sure that the herbicide will work well for your particular weeds.<br><br>Here is info for your local extension office:<br><a href=\"http://extension.oregonstate.edu/yamhill/find-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://extension.oregonstate.edu/yamhill/find-us</a><br><br>Thank you for using Ask an Expert! <br><br>",

                "answer": "The image shows a recently replanted backyard with a significant amount of weed growth emerging from the soil, which was likely a result of the previous grass being sprayed before the soil was leveled. Here's a recommended management strategy to address the weed problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Strategy\n\n1. **Identify the Weeds**:\n   - Determine the type of weeds present. Common weeds that might be growing include dandelions, crabgrass, or other broadleaf weeds. If unsure, you can consult with a local nursery or garden center for identification.\n\n2. **Prevent Further Growth**:\n   - Apply a pre-emergent herbicide to prevent more weeds from sprouting. These products work by blocking the roots of seeds from developing into plants. Be sure to follow the label instructions carefully as pre-emergents are effective only when applied before the seeds germinate.\n\n3. **Spot Treat Existing Weeds**:\n   - Use post-emergent herbicides on existing weeds if they are not effectively controlled by the pre-emergent. Post-emergent herbicides target actively growing weeds and are applied directly to the leaves. Always read and adhere to the application guidelines on the product label.\n\n4. **Mulching**:\n   - Apply mulch around the base of plants and trees to suppress weed growth. This will also help retain moisture in the soil and improve the overall health of your lawn.\n\n5. **Regular Maintenance**:\n   - Maintain regular mowing and watering schedules to ensure your grass is healthy and competitive against weeds. A strong, healthy lawn can naturally suppress weeds through shading and competition.\n\n6. **Fertilize**:\n   - Apply a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy grass growth. This will make your grass stronger and more resistant to weed invasion.\n\n7. **Consider Mechanical Control**:\n   - Use a hoe, hand trowel, or other tools to physically remove small weeds manually. This method is effective but requires consistent effort to keep the area free of weeds.\n\n8. **Check for Underlying Issues**:\n   - Ensure there are no underlying issues such as poor drainage or compacted soil that could contribute to the weed problem. Improving these conditions can help your lawn thrive and outcompete weeds.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the weed problem and enjoy a healthier, more uniform lawn in your newly replanted backyard.",

Voles or meadow mice are active all year round and are notorious for tunneling through mulch (especially in the winter), going underneath shrubs and gnawing on the bark. They are very fond of boxwood. In the third photo, we noticed some missing bark. This type of feeding girdles the stem which eventually dies. So you need to look underneath the shrub to see what is going on. You will need to prune out any damaged stems.

                "answer": "The image shows a cluster of what appears to be black mold or fungus on the roots or trunk of a plum tree. This could potentially be caused by a fungal disease such as Phytophthora root rot, which is common in Michigan and can affect many fruit trees.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**: Confirm the diagnosis by consulting with a local horticulturist or plant pathologist. They may need to take samples for further testing to identify the specific fungal species and determine the appropriate treatment.\n\n2. **Remove Affected Parts**: If the disease is localized (e.g., only affecting a small part of the root system), consider removing and destroying the affected areas to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n3. **Prune Diseased Areas**: Remove any dead or diseased branches and prune back healthy branches to improve air circulation and reduce stress on the tree. Ensure that pruning tools are sanitized after each cut to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n4. **Apply Fungicides**: Depending on the severity and the type of fungus, fungicides such as chlorothalonil or thiophanate-methyl might be necessary. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions carefully, as fungicides can be harmful if not used correctly.\n\n5. **Improve Soil Conditions**: Enhance soil drainage and aeration by adding organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure. This can help the roots recover and promote healthy growth.\n\n6. **Water Management**: Avoid overwatering, especially during wet weather. Ensure the tree is watered deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.\n\n7. **Monitor the Tree**: Regularly check the tree for signs of recovery or new infections. Early detection and treatment are crucial for managing fungal diseases effectively.\n\n8. **Resistance Practices**: If the disease persists despite these measures, consider planting resistant varieties of plum trees in the future. Resistance breeding programs have developed varieties that are more tolerant to certain fungal pathogens.\n\nBy addressing the issue promptly and taking preventive measures, you can help manage the disease and increase the chances of the plum tree recovering and thriving.",

                "answer": "The image shows a plant with leaves that appear to have some discoloration and spots, which could be indicative of a fungal or bacterial infection, insect damage, or nutrient deficiency. Given the context provided, it seems like the plant species is oregano, and the location is Ramsey County, Minnesota.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for addressing the issues observed in the image:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**:\n   - Determine if the spots are due to a disease (fungus or bacteria) or an insect infestation. Observing the leaves closely can help identify signs such as powdery growths (fungus), brown spots (fungus or bacteria), or holes (insects).\n   - Check if the plants are showing signs of nutrient deficiencies by looking at the overall health of the plant and soil quality.\n\n2. **Physical Removal**:\n   - If the affected areas are small and localized, carefully remove them by pruning the infected parts. Ensure to sterilize your pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the problem.\n   - Remove any debris from around the plant to reduce the possibility of reinfection.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application**:\n   - If the cause is identified as a fungal infection, apply a fungicide specifically designed for oregano or broad-spectrum fungicides as directed on the label.\n   - Follow the application instructions carefully to ensure the safety of the plant and the environment.\n\n4. **Insect Control**:\n   - If insects are causing the damage, use an insecticidal soap or neem oil spray as a natural control method.\n   - Avoid using chemical insecticides unless necessary to avoid harming beneficial insects.\n\n5. **Water Management**:\n   - Ensure that the oregano plants are not waterlogged, as overwatering can lead to root rot and other diseases.\n   - Water the plants deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between watering sessions.\n\n6. **Soil Health**:\n   - Test the soil pH and nutrient levels to ensure they are optimal for oregano growth. Adjust as needed with amendments like lime or fertilizer.\n\n7. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - Maintain good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity, which can promote disease development.\n   - Prune regularly to keep the plant healthy and to prevent overcrowding, which can lead to disease and insect infestations.\n\n8. **Monitoring**:\n   - Regularly monitor the plants for new signs of infection or damage and address any issues promptly to prevent their spread",

My best guess at this time is that this is a Three-Lined Potato Beetle (Lema daturaphila). For whatever reason they seem to be rather abundant this season (2022). But, and this is an important but, these beetles are rarely found on tomatoes. Perhaps this critter just happened to land on your plant? See:</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.unh.edu/resource/three-lined-potato-beetle-fact-sheet-0#:~:text=Three%2Dlined%20potato%20beetles%20are,with%20three%20lengthwise%20black%20stripes.\">https://extension.unh.edu/resource/three-lined-potato-beetle-fact-sheet-0 - :~:text=Three-lined potato beetles are,with three lengthwise black stripes.</a></p> <p>My suggestion at this time is just to pick it off your plant as well as any others that may alight. I am hesitant to suggest the spraying of any insecticide as this may have negative impacts upon the edibility of your tomatoes. Just keep monitoring the situation and if there appear any negative effects upon your plants, please get back to us and we can look further into your situation.</p> <p>Best of luck</p>",

                "answer": "The image shows what appears to be tomato hornworms (Manduca quinquemaculata) on a tomato leaf. Tomato hornworms are caterpillars that feed on various plants, including tomatoes, and can cause significant damage if not controlled.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Hand Picking**: Regularly inspect your tomato plants for hornworms and remove them manually. This method is effective but labor-intensive, especially if you have a large number of plants.\n\n2. **Insecticidal Soap**: Apply an insecticidal soap solution directly to the hornworms and leaves where they feed. This is a natural and effective way to control their population without using harsh chemicals. Be sure to read and follow the label instructions carefully.\n\n3. **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**: Bt is a biological pesticide that targets only caterpillars and is safe for other beneficial insects. Apply the Bt solution according to the instructions on the product label.\n\n4. **Hornworm Moth Trap**: If you suspect you may have an infestation, set up traps for the adult hornworm moths. These traps can help reduce the population before the larvae hatch.\n\n5. **Natural Predators**: Encourage beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps by maintaining a diverse garden habitat. These natural predators will help keep the hornworm population under control.\n\n6. **Neem Oil**: Neem oil is another organic pesticide that can be applied to tomato plants. It disrupts the development of hornworms by preventing them from feeding properly. Apply it according to the directions on the product label.\n\n7. **Cultural Practices**: Maintain healthy plant practices such as proper watering, fertilization, and pruning. Strong, healthy plants are less susceptible to pest infestations.\n\n8. **Rotate Crops**: Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year to prevent build-up of pests and diseases.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to manage the tomato hornworm population effectively and protect your tomato plants. Monitor your plants regularly to ensure early detection and treatment of any new infestations.",

The intermittent appearance of the browning and the fact that it appears to be on one side of the tree would indicate the problem is occasional root die-back which is most likely caused by environmental conditions. Heat or lack of water to the root could cause this.<br /> <br /> If the browning is confined to this face of the tree, I suggest it may be the fact that a portion of the roots are covered by the concrete sidewalk. If you irrigate, try watering on the opposite side of the walk to encourage the roots to grow out to the moisture. The tree may need more water in general, and it would be very beneficial to have 3 to 4 inches of wood chip mulch out to and beyond the drip line of the tree.\u00a0<br /> <br /> It does not appear serious, however, as extreme weather events become more common, you (and your tree) should be prepared. Try these suggestions and see if the symptoms dissipate over time.<br /> <br /> ",

Caution: the white sap is toxic so don't get on skin or in eyes.<br>If it has white sap, it is a Euphorbia, likely Euphorbia tirucalli (Pencil Cactus or Pencil Tree). There are other pencil-shaped Euphorbia, so do an image search for those. Try terms \"stick-like\" or \"tubular\" as well.<br>Possibly the flower, the plant size, and branch/leaf size will tell help you tell them apart. Here is an information page from the University of Arkansas about the pencil cactus: <a href=\"http://www.uaex.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/pencil-cactus.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uaex.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/pencil-cactus.aspx</a> <br>I thought the yellow flowers would help tell these apart, but the other plant this might be has yellow flowers too. To see photos, do an internet image search with the plant name and add \"yellow flowers\". The option that does NOT have white sap is one of the plants in the Rhipsalideae tribe of plants, Hatiora salicornioides. Your plant doesn't have the same joints on the stems, so I don't think this is the identification. Still, look at images online and see if they match the type of flower you saw.\u00a0 <br><br><br><br><br><br>",

This condition could be indicative of several issues such as environmental stress, disease, or pest infestation. Here\u2019s a recommended management strategy based on the provided background information:\n\n1. **Assess the Cause**: Determine the exact cause of the leaf discoloration. Common causes include:\n   - **Disease**: Check for signs of fungal or bacterial infections. Symptoms can vary but may include discoloration, browning, or wilting of leaves.\n   - **Pests**: Look for signs of insect infestations such as spider mites, aphids, or borers which can cause leaf damage.\n   - **Environmental Stress**: Assess if the tree is experiencing excessive heat, cold, drought, or excessive moisture. Ensure the soil is neither too dry nor waterlogged.\n\n2. **Water Management**: Since the water in the ground is tested normal to wet, ensure the tree is not overwatered. Overwatering can lead to root rot and other issues. Monitor the soil moisture levels regularly and adjust watering as needed.\n\n3. **Pruning**: If the tree has significant dead branches, prune them back to healthy wood. Pruning should be done when the tree is dormant to minimize stress and reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Test the soil pH and nutrient levels to determine if fertilization is necessary. Apply appropriate fertilizers according to the test results to ensure the tree receives the correct nutrients.\n\n5. **Consult an Expert**: If the issue persists after implementing these steps, consider consulting with a professional arborist who can provide a more detailed diagnosis and treatment plan specific to your tree's needs.\n\n6. **Monitor Regularly**: Regular monitoring is crucial to detect any new issues early and manage them effectively. Keep track of the tree\u2019s health and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage and potentially resolve the issues affecting the tree.",

The wood chips vary in color from light beige to dark brown, indicating different types of wood or stages of decomposition.\n\n3. **Dried Plant Material**: There are scattered pieces of dried plant material, including brown, leafy remnants and possibly some moss or fern-like structures, adding to the natural debris on the ground.\n\n4. **Soil**: Beneath the wood chips and plant debris, there is soil visible, which appears dark and moist, hinting at recent rainfall or watering.\n\n5. **Lighting**: The lighting seems natural, likely taken outdoors during daylight hours. The shadows cast by the wood chips suggest that the sun was positioned at an angle, possibly late afternoon or early evening as indicated by the timestamp.\n\nThe overall scene gives off a sense of a forest floor or a garden bed, with the fresh green growth contrasting against the dry, decaying vegetation.",

It get good moisture and very little direct sunlight. It is in open shade 95% of the day with only direct sun in late afternoon. the photos show the leaf discoloration from the top side and bottom side. I did find some insect silk under just a few of the leaf clusters as shown in one photo. I did not detect any silk in a larger percentage of the leaf clusters, and nearly all leaf clusters show discoloration and curling. There are more photos if that would be helpful. \r\n\r\nThanks!",

                "response": "The leaf symptoms fortunately appear minor and resemble scorch, which is just physiological (as opposed to pest- or disease-caused) damage, likely from weather conditions or soil moisture fluctuations.\u00a0It's good if the roots have stable access to moisture as dogwoods are not highly drought-tolerant (and our season to date has been drier than normal with periods of mild drought in much of MD). If you aren't already monitoring it for watering needs, just in case it's getting dry, feel the soil around six inches deep in the root zone and water well only if it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Dogwood leaf symptoms from over-watering or overly-wet soil often don't appear until the roots have been struggling for some time.<br /> <br /> The silk is probably from a young or small spider and isn't a concern. The few silk-producing insect pests of dogwood don't appear this early in the season and would make a much more prominent silken \"nests\"\u00a0from gregariously-feeding caterpillars, so would also be resulting in some defoliation. Dogwoods are <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/key-common-problems-dogwoods\">vulnerable to a few leaf infections</a>\u00a0(more so the native species than the Kousa varieties)\u00a0but this year most trees seem to have bypassed a significant infection event due to our drier spring weather. Even so, some leaf spotting could be due to comparatively minor fungal issues. A fungicide isn't warranted (nor can it cure any existing infection) and may risk harming pollinators or other organisms while also not guaranteed to work well, which is why we generally discourage their use. For now, just keep monitoring the tree for watering needs and feel free to send us updated photos if you notice worsening or different symptoms.<br /> <br /> Miri",

Here's a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Preventive Measures**:\n   - **Fertilization**: Apply a balanced fertilizer that includes nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at appropriate rates and intervals to promote healthy turf growth and compete against weeds.\n   - **Aeration**: Core aeration can help improve soil structure and reduce compaction, which aids in better water penetration and root development, making the lawn more competitive against annual bluegrass.\n\n2. **Control Measures**:\n   - **Regular Mowing**: Maintain the lawn at an appropriate height (typically 3 inches) to encourage deeper root growth and reduce the opportunity for weeds to establish.\n   - **Mulching**: Apply a thin layer of mulch around plants and trees to help suppress weeds by blocking sunlight from reaching their seedlings.\n   - **Irrigation**: Water the lawn deeply but infrequently to encourage deep-rooted grasses and reduce the spread of shallow-rooted weeds like annual bluegrass.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Pre-Emergent Herbicides**: Use pre-emergent herbicides like pendimethalin or haloxyfop-potassium in the late winter or early spring to prevent annual bluegrass seeds from germinating. Apply these chemicals according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n   - **Post-Emergent Herbicides**: If the annual bluegrass has already germinated, use post-emergent herbicides such as glyphosate or triclopyr. These should be applied carefully to avoid harming desirable grasses. Always follow the label directions and consider applying during cooler temperatures and avoiding periods of drought or extreme heat.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Avoid Over-Sowing**: Avoid excessive seeding or over-fertilizing which can lead to a dense thatch layer that favors annual bluegrass.\n   - **Dethatching**: Remove thatch buildup using a dethatcher if it becomes thick, as it can hinder proper nutrient absorption and water penetration.\n\n5. **Mechanical Removal**:\n   - **Hand Pulling**: Manually remove small patches of annual bluegrass. While time-consuming, this method can be effective for smaller areas.\n   - **Cultivator**: Use a cultivator to loosen the soil and remove the roots of annual bluegrass, although this might require multiple passes to ensure all roots are removed.\n\n6.",

Crabgrass can outcompete other grass species like tall fescue, especially during warm weather. Here\u2019s a recommended management strategy for the issue:\n\n1. **Identification**: Confirm that the patches are indeed crabgrass by observing its characteristics such as its upright, coarse stems and the small, round seeds at the end of its branches.\n\n2. **Prevention**:\n   - **Mulch**: Apply mulch around plants and trees to reduce light reaching the soil, which can help prevent crabgrass from germinating.\n   - **Proper Fertilization**: Maintain a healthy lawn by fertilizing regularly with a balanced fertilizer. Avoid excessive nitrogen, as it can promote rapid growth of crabgrass.\n   - **Watering**: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep-rooted grass, which can compete better against crabgrass.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Pre-Emergent Herbicides**: Use pre-emergent herbicides in late winter or early spring before crabgrass seeds germinate. These products work by preventing crabgrass seeds from growing into seedlings.\n   - **Post-Emergent Herbicides**: If crabgrass is already established, use post-emergent herbicides. These products target existing crabgrass and should be applied when the crabgrass is actively growing.\n\n4. **Physical Removal**:\n   - **Hand Pulling**: Manually pull up crabgrass seedlings while they are young and before they set seeds. Be thorough to ensure you remove all roots.\n   - **Tilling**: Till the affected areas to disrupt the crabgrass roots and seed bank. This is effective but can be labor-intensive and may damage the soil structure.\n\n5. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Regular Mowing**: Keep the lawn mowed at the recommended height (typically between 2.5 to 3 inches). This helps control crabgrass by shading the ground where it can germinate.\n   - **Aerate the Lawn**: Aerating the lawn can improve soil health and allow grass to grow stronger and more vigorously, which can outcompete crabgrass.\n\n6. **Maintenance**:\n   - **Keep the Lawn Healthy**: Regularly inspect the lawn for signs of stress (e.g., yellowing, thinning) and address issues promptly. A strong, healthy lawn is less susceptible to crabgrass invasion.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and reduce the",

Some branches appear darker and more twisted, possibly indicating older growth or weathering.\n\n4. **Sky**: The background shows a light sky, possibly overcast due to the diffused lighting. This suggests it might not be a bright sunny day, but rather cloudy or slightly gloomy conditions.\n\n5. **Vegetation Density**: The overall density of the vegetation indicates a thriving ecosystem, with no signs of bare ground or clearings visible from this vantage point.\n\nThe image gives a sense of a natural, undisturbed forest setting, typical of the diverse landscapes found in Minnesota's Dakota County during the warmer months.",

Since these parts are the last to be supplied with water from the roots, they are usually the first to be affected. Leaves with scorched margins may look unappealing, but they still help the plant with photosynthesis, creating food for new, undamaged leaves to emerge. Resist the urge to remove scorched leaves.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Once leaf scorch has occurred, there is no cure. The leaves that have already turned brown will not recover, The dehydrated portions of the leaf will not turn green again, but with proper water management, the tree may recover. Prevention of scorch needs to begin with winter watering. BUT as long as you water it properly, the rest of the tree should survive. Deep watering is recommended \u2013 a slow, deep soaking of the soil at the roots.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Links on Leaf Scorch:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Please read the section on Leaf Scorch in this MSUE Bulletin at this link: <a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/files/MapleEnvironmentalStresses_MSUE-1213.pdf\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/files/MapleEnvironmentalStresses_MSUE-1213.pdf</a></strong><br /> <br /> <strong><a href=\"http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/physiologicalleafscorch.pdf\">http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/physiologicalleafscorch.pdf</a></strong><br /> <br /> <strong><a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/leaf-scorch-2-911/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/leaf-scorch-2-911/</a></strong><br /> <br /> <strong>If you want to get a confirmed diagnosis from the MSU Plant and Pest Diagnostics Lab on the MSU campus (Just to make sure it is NOT Bacterial Leaf Scorch)</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Please e-mail your images to the MSU Plant and Pest Diagnostics Lab on the MSU campus.

They've been eating plants in the garden and one of our large black walnut trees has been completely defoliated and others have been partially. I think it is the Spongy Moth but I'd like to confirm. I would also like to know what can be done to control the infestation and how we can help the trees, both ones that are already impacted and others nearby. I am particularly worried about the one that has been completely eaten. Black walnuts have a very short season to photosynthesize and it does not have a single leaf left on it.

If you can, you might want to contact <a href=\"http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/people/brandon-schroeder/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/people/brandon-schroeder/</a> at Michigan Sea Grant and he might have more local details and be able to assist with plant ID. Be sure of the ID - If you aren't treating the right plant with the right material, you are wasting your time and money.<br>I'm pretty sure about the pondweed ID, and it is a native plant that is great for fish habitat and pond health. If you feel the need to control the amount (a healthy pond will have 30% native vegetation to support fish and wildlife), you can treat with herbicides. However, that is like cutting grass, and  is not a permanent fix. Long-term, we find most plant problems are nutrient problems. A vegetated buffer of  6-10 feet is desirable rather than cutting to the edge of the pond to intercept runoff and nutrients. Resident Canada goose populations will add lots of bacteria and nutrients and should be discouraged. Fertilization of lawn areas around the pond is not a good idea, and should be avoided. for more information on pond ecology and plant management, visit <a href=\"http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/ponds\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/ponds</a>. The permitting information is not useful for Michigan, for that, speak to Brandon, but the plant management information all applies.<br>In general, pondweeds can be limited by using a shading agent in the spring (when most management should begin) like Aquashade. Aquathol-K, Komeen, Reward/Weedtreen-D, and Sonar all work on pondweeds, but I don't know which ones are approved in Michigan. Treat no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of a pond at a time if you have heavy vegetation to avoid fish kills from depleted oxygen.   <br><br><br>",

                "answer": "The image shows Variable Leaf Pondweed (Potamogeton crispus), which is a type of aquatic plant that can grow rapidly and become invasive in ponds and other bodies of water. In Alpena County, Michigan, as observed on August 7, 2014, the presence of this species can be problematic due to its tendency to outcompete native vegetation, alter water flow, reduce oxygen levels, and potentially affect fish habitat.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for controlling Variable Leaf Pondweed:\n\n1. **Mechanical Removal**: This involves physically removing the plants from the water using specialized boats equipped with rakes or other tools designed for aquatic vegetation. This method can be effective but may need to be repeated multiple times depending on how quickly the plant regrows.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**: Herbicides such as diquat or chlorpyrifos can be used to control Variable Leaf Pondweed. These chemicals are typically applied in the early stages of growth to minimize the risk of drift onto nontarget areas. However, it's crucial to follow all label instructions carefully and consider the environmental impact before application.\n\n3. **Biological Control**: Introducing biological controls like certain types of algae or insects that feed on the pondweed can help manage the plant population. However, this approach requires careful consideration and should be evaluated by experts to ensure it does not have unintended negative effects on the ecosystem.\n\n4. **Preventative Measures**: Implementing practices such as creating buffer zones around the pond with native vegetation can help prevent the spread of pondweed into the water. Additionally, maintaining good water quality through proper waste management and limiting nutrient runoff can also help deter the growth of invasive aquatic plants.\n\n5. **Physical Barriers**: Installing physical barriers such as underwater netting or floating barriers can help contain the spread of the pondweed by preventing it from moving further into the pond.\n\nGiven the rapid growth observed in the image, a combination of mechanical removal and chemical control might be the most immediate and effective approach. It's important to consult with local aquatic weed management professionals or state agencies to ensure the chosen methods are appropriate and compliant with local regulations.",

                "answer": "The plant species visible in the image is Lysimachia nummularia, commonly known as moneywort or creeping Jenny. This species can be highly invasive in aquatic environments, particularly in slow-moving streams like those found in the Gunpowder River system in Maryland. The management strategy for invasive plants like Lysimachia nummularia in aquatic systems should focus on preventing its spread and reducing its presence in natural waterways.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: Manually remove the plants from the stream bed and surrounding areas. Care must be taken to avoid disturbing the streambed too much, which could lead to erosion or harm aquatic life. It is often best to remove small patches at a time and to contain the removed plants rather than simply discarding them back into the stream.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**: Herbicides can be used to control Lysimachia nummularia. However, chemical treatments should be applied with caution to avoid harming other plants or aquatic organisms. Always follow label instructions carefully and consider the environmental impact of using chemicals. Treatment may need to be repeated if the plants regrow.\n\n3. **Biological Control**: Introducing biological controls, such as specific insects or diseases that target Lysimachia nummularia, might be an option. This approach requires careful evaluation and monitoring to ensure that the introduced organism does not cause unintended ecological harm.\n\n4. **Preventive Measures**: To prevent the spread of Lysimachia nummularia, it is crucial to manage the surrounding vegetation and maintain healthy native plant communities. Native plants can help stabilize the streambank and provide habitat for beneficial insects and other organisms, which can help suppress invasive species.\n\n5. **Educational Outreach**: Educating landowners and property managers about the dangers of invasive species and the importance of responsible management practices can help reduce the introduction and spread of Lysimachia nummularia and other invasive species.\n\n6. **Stream Restoration**: Restoring the stream ecosystem by removing excess sediment, improving water flow, and enhancing riparian vegetation can make the environment less favorable for invasive species and more suitable for native flora and fauna.\n\nIn summary, a combination of physical removal, chemical control, and preventive measures, along with educational outreach, would be effective in managing the spread of Lysimachia nummularia in the Gunpowder River system. It's important to work closely with local environmental agencies and conservation groups to develop and implement a comprehensive management plan.",

Some of the leaves are 7 inches long. The leaves are opposite each other and staggered and have serrated edges. The top side of leaf is very coarse.

Herbicides need to be applied when plants are actively growing and follow the directions about whether or not, it should be watered in. Most weeds are actively growing this month so June is a good time to apply a broadleaved weed killer. If you applied it earlier, it might have been too cold for a lot of active growth to occur. Perhaps you could bring the weed down to a large, local garden center that sells lawn care products. Maybe someone could identify it for you and recommend which herbicide to use. </p>",

                "answer": "The image depicts three individuals enjoying a casual outdoor gathering, possibly a social event or a community meet-up. However, the background information provided pertains to a gardening or landscaping issue rather than a social one. The problem described involves the presence of broad leaf weeds in Onondaga County, New York, specifically around the time mentioned (June 5, 2020).\n\nGiven the information about the failure of Scott Dandelion and Weed Killer at various strengths and the abundance of weeds that cannot be easily dug up, here are some general recommendations for managing broad leaf weeds:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: If possible, hand-pull the weeds while they are small. This can be effective for smaller areas.\n\n2. **Mulching**: Apply a thick layer of organic mulch over the soil to smother the weeds. This blocks sunlight from reaching the weed seeds and roots, preventing them from growing.\n\n3. **Herbicides**: Consider using selective herbicides designed for broadleaf weeds. Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully as different herbicides have different application rates and conditions.\n\n4. **Pre-emergent Herbicides**: These prevent new weeds from emerging by blocking the germination of seeds. They need to be applied before weeds start to grow.\n\n5. **Post-emergent Herbicides**: These kill already existing weeds. Make sure to apply them when the weeds are actively growing and the weather conditions are suitable for absorption into the plant tissue.\n\n6. **Biological Control**: Some species of fungi and bacteria can control certain types of weeds. These products may be available for use on ornamental plants.\n\n7. **Cover Crops**: Planting cover crops like clover or alfalfa can help suppress weeds by competing for resources and creating a dense ground cover.\n\n8. **Regular Maintenance**: Keeping the area well-maintained with regular mowing and weeding will help reduce the seed bank of weeds.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific type of weeds, environmental conditions, and the overall health of the plants you are trying to protect. Consulting with a local Extension Service or horticulturist might provide more tailored advice based on your specific situation.",

        "question": "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy name is layne and I live in Lakeway, TX.  I have attached a picture of a tree in my back yard.  I am pretty sure it is an Arizona Ash tree.  After our drastic freeze this past winter, the buds on the limbs really took a hit and have not leafed out.  However, as you can see on the trunk and lower limbs there are a lot of sucker branches growing. There is no green foliage in the upper part of the tree.  (it looks like there is but that is a branch from another tree)\r\n\r\nI am considering having the 4 or 5 large vertical limbs cut off above where the suckers are.  Is this advisable or should I just have the entire tree removed?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLayne Thomas\r\n512-261-8922",

                "response": "<p>Hi Layne,<br />It is taking a long time for some trees to recover from the freeze - and frankly, I am not sure that anyone knows exactly how long it will take. Nevertheless, sections that have not leafed out by now are most likely not going to do so.<br />I would not cut down the whole tree, since the roots are clearly intact and you seem to have strong growth near the bottom. However, you need to establish whether the tree section above the current growth is dead or alive. If you are able to get above the current growth, you may want to try and scratch back the bark to see if it is green underneath. You could also try cutting one of the smaller branches to see if it is dead (dry and brown) or showing signs of life (green and moist).<br />If the top section of the tree is dead, it should be removed or it will rot and become a danger-risk. You can always leave the lower section. It may take a couple of years to recover, but it would seem a better option than losing the whole tree. <br /><br /></p><p>Liz</p> <p>Travis County Master Gardeners</p> <p>Buy our Award-Winning \"Garden Guide for Austin and Vicinity\": <a href=\"http://www.tcmastergardeners.org/garden-guide-for-austin-and-vicinity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"1\">http://www.tcmastergardeners.org/garden-guide-for-austin-and-vicinity/</a><br /></p> <p>Garden in extreme Central Texas weather with \"From Drought to Deluge: The Resilient Central Texas Garden\" <a href=\"https://www.tcmastergardeners.org/drought-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"2\">https://www.tcmastergardeners.org/drought-guide/</a><br /></p> <p>For live support, call our help desk at 512 710 7098 (leave a message)</p> <p>Support TCMGA by shopping with Amazon Smile: <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/ch/74-2730023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"3\">https://smile.amazon.com/ch/74-2730023</a></p> <p>\ue712ReplyForwardL<br /></p>",

Since our rainfall is slightly acidic,\nthe limestone reacts with our rain and melts the stone. If you don\u2019t realize\nhow quickly this actually happens, take a look at the new rock outcrops along a\nnew highway and then look again a few years later. As the stone dissolves,\ncavities result, some expanding to become very large, such as the Cave of the\nMounds. Didn\u2019t you ever wonder where the limestone gravel or sand went that\nallowed a cavity to form under your driveway? This disintegration of the limestone gravels under your\nwalks, driveway, patio, and around your trees, shrubs and flowers changes the\nchemistry of the soil into an alkaline or higher pH medium.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong in my guess, but this would\nexplain the rapidity with which these spots occurred.\u00a0 Also if you look at the center and the right\npictures that you initially sent, don\u2019t the white spots resemble some type of\nwater flow?</p>\n\n<p>I will be very interested in hearing back from you to see if\nthis explanation is plausible.\u00a0 If\ncorrect, then we can discuss remedial steps.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!!</p>",

They like to cut holes in leaves to use in lining their nests and protect the eggs of their offspring. Most often though they cut multiple holes into a leaf. The bees are harmless and good pollinators.

However, as Master Gardener Volunteers we prefer know what were treating.\u00a0My suggestion is to look at the underside of the leaves. Do you see any bugs? Is anything crawling on the plant. The images don't show anything but you were trying to capture the holes.\u00a0 If you find anything, please write back and send images.</p> <p>Thank you. Sincerely, Sabine</p> <p><br /></p> ",

The leaves seem to have some holes or damage, which could be indicative of pest infestation, such as leaf-eating insects like aphids, spider mites, or caterpillars. Here's a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Identify the Pest**: First, determine the type of pest causing the damage. This can often be done by observing the symptoms and the behavior of the insects. For example, aphids tend to cluster on the undersides of leaves, while spider mites produce a webbing on the leaves.\n\n2. **Isolate the Plant**: If the pest is localized, isolate the affected plant from healthy plants to prevent the spread of pests.\n\n3. **Hand Picking**: If the infestation is small, you can manually remove the pests using a soft-bristled brush or a gentle stream of water from a hose.\n\n4. **Use Insecticidal Soap or Neem Oil**: These natural products can be effective against many pests. Apply them according to the instructions on the product label, ensuring that you thoroughly coat all parts of the plant, including the undersides of the leaves.\n\n5. **Introduce Beneficial Insects**: Some beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings, can help control pest populations naturally. Release these beneficial insects if possible.\n\n6. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the plant for signs of new infestations or re-infestations. Repeat treatments as necessary.\n\n7. **Maintain Plant Health**: Ensure the plant is receiving adequate sunlight, water, and nutrients. Healthy plants are more resistant to pests and diseases.\n\n8. **Physical Removal**: If the infestation is severe, consider physically removing and disposing of the damaged leaves or stems to reduce the habitat for the pests.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the pest problem effectively and maintain the health of your Hibiscus plant.",

                "answer": "The image shows an agricultural field that appears to be planted with kochia (a common weed), which is evident from the dense, small green plants growing on what looks like tilled soil. This suggests that despite efforts to disc and plant grasses for grazing, the kochia has taken over the area.\n\nGiven the context provided about the failed hemp grower and the subsequent planting with grasses that did not thrive, the following management strategies could be recommended:\n\n1. **Herbicide Application**: Since the kochia is already established, applying an appropriate herbicide might be necessary to control its growth. Herbicides effective against kochia include glyphosate or dicamba. However, it's crucial to choose the right herbicide based on local regulations and weather conditions. Always consult with a local agronomist or pesticide applicator for specific recommendations.\n\n2. **Mechanical Control**: Mechanical methods such as repeated mowing or tillage can help reduce the kochia population, although it may not completely eliminate the weed. This approach should be used in conjunction with chemical treatments to ensure thorough control.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Enhancing cultural practices such as improved soil fertility and irrigation management could potentially encourage desired grass species to germinate and thrive. This might involve adding organic matter to the soil and ensuring adequate moisture levels for the grasses to establish themselves.\n\n4. **Preventative Measures**: For future land use, consider using cover crops or other grazing mixes that are more resistant to kochia. Planting a diverse mix of grasses and legumes might help in reducing the establishment of weeds like kochia.\n\n5. **Replanting**: If the land is intended for grazing, replanting with a suitable grass species after proper preparation (e.g., incorporating organic matter, proper seed selection) might be necessary. Ensure that the new planting includes a mix of grasses that are well-suited to the local climate and soil conditions.\n\nIn summary, a combination of herbicide application and mechanical methods followed by improved cultural practices would likely provide the most effective management strategy for controlling kochia and promoting desired vegetation in the field. Always follow local regulations and seek professional advice before implementing any treatment.",

                "response": "<p>Hello Jeremy,</p><p>The white spots on the bark look like Japanese Maple Scale, a pest of increasing frequency in home landscapes. Despite the name, this pest feeds on a wide range of trees and shrubs, not just Japanese Maple; the maple hybrid you have is one of the host plants for this scale. They are very difficult to control effectively. More information and images can be found in the links below.</p><p>Your tree\u2019s current level of population is very high and could impact the tree's overall health, though we can see that some have already been killed by beneficial insects. (There are small circular holes in a number of the scale covers, indicating parasitoids have already done the work of consuming some of the scale insects.) Dead scale don't always detach from the bark and fall off right away, so it's hard to tell from photographs how many on the trunk are dead versus still living and breeding. It's likely that a tree of this size and showing this high a population has had an infestation for several years. The nursery that grew it could have already treated for the scale before it was purchased and planted; it depends on how long it's been in the yard.</p> <p>You could replace the tree if it appears to be struggling, or you could opt to treat it.\u00a0For the latter, all you can do on your own is to monitor for crawlers and spray the trunk with horticultural oil at that time. Crawlers are the most vulnerable stage in a scale's life cycle, and as the name implies, they crawl around finding a place to feed, after which point they do not move again and protect themselves with this brown and white\u00a0waxy covering. You can use pieces of double-sided tape snugly wrapped around some of the branches to catch them as they move about, since they are otherwise very hard to see. When detected, that is when you spray. Usually, crawler emergence in Maryland occurs starting in June, but unfortunately can last well into the summer.</p> <p>Horticultural oil is the only spray recommended (note that this is not the same as neem oil); be sure to use a dilution of 1% - if you get a concentrated product, it should have dilution instructions for this \"summer rate\" on the label. Otherwise, ready-to-spray products are fine, though maybe impractical since it will take several bottles to cover a trunk of this size, and they may be at too-high a concentration if above 1% active ingredient. Do not spray when temperatures are above 85 degrees because this will damage the tree; if sprays are needed during a heat wave, this means applications are made either early morning or evening. While plant-safe under the right conditions, horticultural oil can easily \"burn\" the plant's foliage if applied when it's too hot or is cloudy, rainy or very humid. Very thorough coverage of all bark surfaces is important, and in doing so, getting oil on the foliage will be unavoidable - hence the precautions.</p> <p>A \"dormant\" oil application, a rate of 2-3% concentration, can be used again around November, as foliage will be shedding and not vulnerable to burn at that time.</p> <p>The alternative - or added - treatment method is to hire a professional pesticide applicator (often employed by landscaping or tree-care companies) to make treatments with products not available to homeowners. In this case, IGR (insect growth regulator) products are best, though may be more expensive. The trade-off is that these products may have better long-term effectiveness and won't need to be re-applied as often.\u00a0Worst-case, it will take two years of alternating oil and IGR treatments to get the population under control. Again, from what we can see here, we can't be certain most of these scale are still alive, so if you already use a professional landscaping service, you can ask them to check the tree and inspect for live scale, their eggs, or crawlers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/publications/FS-967%20Japanese%20Maple%20Scale.pdf\">https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/publications/FS-967%20Japanese%20Maple%20Scale.pdf</a> (Note that publication is mainly written for nursery growers and licensed pesticide applicators, so chemical listings aren't all available to homeowners.)</p><p><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/armored-hard-scale-trees-and-shrubs\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/armored-hard-scale-trees-and-shrubs</a> (This is a general page for the armored scale group of scale pests. It doesn't yet address Japanese Maple Scale, but the main points and management tips are the same. Your tree is young enough that pruning to manage populations is not recommended or practical.)</p><p>Miri</p>",

                "response": "Hello,<br /> <br /> I believe that the azaleas have red headed flea beetles. Flea beetles in general are common pests, native to our area,\u00a0that eat small holes\u00a0in a wide variety of plants.\u00a0<br /> <br /> They are normally not harmful to a plant unless 20-30 percent of the leaf is destroyed. For that reason, the articles on treatment for flea beetles are mainly concentrated on greenhouse and nursery\u00a0environments where infestations spread quickly. Information for home treatments are difficult to find.<br /> <br /> The eggs, which overwinter in the soil,\u00a0normally hatch in June. There could be more than one to two\u00a0generations of adults in a growing season.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Because of the flea beetles' habit of hopping, treatments by chemicals or insecticidal soaps are not always guaranteed. There are natural predators of flea beetles and so caution is advised if you should opt to use sprays on these pests. The natural predators, such as parasitoid wasps, could help to control the population. Populations of native insects also tend to vary year to year.<br /> If using a chemical spray,\u00a0\u00a0remember that label directions must be followed precisely in order\u00a0to avoid danger to you, children,\u00a0pets, plants and other insects.<br /> <br /> It is recommended to keep weeds and plant debris away from an infested plant. Red headed flea beetles are attracted to and\u00a0eat many kinds of weeds as well as other plants.<br /> <br /> Please read the articles below about flea beetles and\u00a0write back if you should have more questions.<br /> <br /> Thanks for asking Ask Extension.<br /> <br /> Betsy B. - MGV<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.uky.edu/Ag/Entomology/treepestguide/azalea.html\">https://www.uky.edu/Ag/Entomology/treepestguide/azalea.html</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/flea-beetles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Open link in new tab.\">https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/flea-beetles</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.unh.edu/blog/2020/06/how-do-i-get-rid-flea-beetles-my-vegetable-garden\">https://extension.unh.edu/blog/2020/06/how-do-i-get-rid-flea-beetles-my-vegetable-garden</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://getbusygardening.com/controlling-flea-beetles/\">https://getbusygardening.com/controlling-flea-beetles/</a>",

The spots you see are actually raised bumps, called \"galls\" that contain immature forms of these aphid-like insects.<br><br>This insect does its damage at the time of budbreak, so there is nothing you can do now to stop the damage. The tree will form new foliage over then next few weeks. Your crop may be partially or completely lost for that tree. Not all trees on a particular property may show the problem each year (and we don't know why), but there is some chance for spread, and trees with the problem this year are likely to show it next year. An insecticide must be applied at budbreak to all of the canopy to prevent this from happening again.<br><br>This diagnosis is based on your one picture. There are possibly other things contributing to foliage drop, but pecan phylloxera is at least one thing that you have.<br><br><br>",

The lawn appears green but shows some patches where the grass seems to be worn or sparse.\n\n4. **Road and Pathway**: To the right of the tree is a paved roadway that curves gently to the left. A dirt path or driveway can also be seen leading towards a house in the background.\n\n5. **Background Trees**: Behind the tree and along the road are mature trees with dense foliage, indicating a lush, green environment typical of late summer.\n\n6. **House and RV**: In the background on the left side of the image, there is a house with a gray exterior and an RV parked next to it. This suggests a residential setting.\n\n7. **Open Field**: Beyond the trees and the paved road, there appears to be an open field, possibly farmland, which is common in areas of Scott County, Minnesota.\n\n8. **Overcast Sky**: The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a tranquil, well-maintained suburban or rural setting with a focus on the new planting of a tree, reflecting efforts in landscaping and maintaining the property.",

However if you would like to treat it, there is options. As far as not harming beneficial insects go. Dormant oil and the insecticidal soap are the best options. As they only affect what is presently on your tree.\u00a0The other options include pesticides like carbaryl, which is bad for bees and pollinators.\u00a0\u00a0As far as brands go for horticultural oil.\u00a0I don't think any one is necessarily\u00a0better than another just make sure, as with all pesticides and herbicides go.\u00a0Follow the instructions on the products label. I would however because of the time of year, suggest you get the summer formulations.\u00a0I will attach some added information on using horticultural oils for treating adelgid and scale.</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hope this helps you fight off those fuzzy pests.

                "response": "Thank you for your question. Given the condition of the snake in your photo, it's difficult to make a positive identification. I believe it's what's left of a Florida watersnake, scientific name Nerodia fasciata pictiventris. All watersnakes in the genus Nerodia are non-venomous. Typical length is approximately three feet, and maximum length can be slightly over five feet.<br><br>They are found in most types of water body, including rivers, lakes, swamps, marshes, ponds, bayous, wetlands and reservoirs. They feed on fish and amphibians.<br><br>At the first sign of a threat, these snakes will try to escape to the water. If they are cornered, they will flatten their head and body in an attempt to make themselves appear larger. If you get too close they will strike repeatedly. If you pick them up without restraining their head, they will bite repeatedly and discharge a strong-smelling musk from their anal glands. <br><br>Because these snake can be stout bodied and spend much of their time in and around the water, they are often misidentified as the venomous cottonmouth, and needlessly killed.<br><br>Here's a link the the University of Florida's Florida Museum's webpage on this species:<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/herpetology/fl-snakes/identification/snake-id-q27-southern-water/\">https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/herpetology/fl-snakes/identification/snake-id-q27-southern-water/</a><br><br>If you are interested in learning more about snake species in Florida, an excellent field guide that includes Florida species is:<br><br>Gibbons, Whit.

Roughstalk bluegrass is a perennial grass that thrives in moist, shady, or over-watered areas. Patches enlarge in the soil by stolons, which are modified above-ground stems. These stolons are not well-rooted in the soil.\u00a0Therefore, these patches can dry out during hot, dry summer months.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no selective herbicides for control of roughstalk bluegrass. Patches may be controlled with one or two applications of glyphosate (Roundup, others). Once these patches are removed you can reseed.\u00a0 Many cultural practices can discourage the growth of roughstalk bluegrass, such as deep and infrequent watering, high mowing height, and good drainage to remove excess water.<br /> For residential lawns, there are not a lot of options for removing weedy grasses from desired grasses.\u00a0 In most cases killing off the grass or digging up the patches\u00a0and then reseeding is the only option.\u00a0\u00a0",

                "answer": "The image shows a lawn with patches of grass that appear to be roughstalk bluegrass (Poa trivialis). Roughstalk bluegrass can sometimes overtake other desirable grasses and become a dominant species in lawns, leading to an uneven appearance and potential issues with maintenance.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for roughstalk bluegrass:\n\n1. **Chemical Control**:\n   - Apply selective herbicides that target broadleaf weeds while sparing grasses. Products such as 2,4-D or dicamba can help control unwanted broadleaf weeds that may be competing with the bluegrass.\n   - For established lawns, broadcast the herbicide evenly across the affected areas and water it in thoroughly to enhance absorption.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Fertilization**: Ensure your lawn is properly fertilized. Use a balanced fertilizer that includes nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This can help improve overall grass health and competitiveness against the bluegrass.\n   - **Aerating**: Core aeration helps improve soil structure and water infiltration, which can be beneficial for maintaining a healthy lawn.\n   - **Mowing**: Maintain the lawn at the appropriate height for the species of grass present. Higher mowing heights can help reduce competition from weeds and improve the health of the grass.\n\n3. **Physical Removal**:\n   - **Hand Pulling**: If the infestation is small, hand-pulling can be effective. Be sure to remove the entire plant, including the roots, to prevent re-seeding.\n   - **Mulching**: Applying a layer of mulch around existing plants can help suppress new growth of roughstalk bluegrass by reducing light penetration and competing for resources.\n\n4. **Mechanical Control**:\n   - **Lawnmower Settings**: Adjust your lawnmower to a higher cutting height to provide better shade for the grass, which can help in suppressing the bluegrass.\n   - **Edging**: Regularly edge the lawn to prevent roughstalk bluegrass from spreading into border areas where it may not be as easily controlled.\n\n5. **Proactive Maintenance**:\n   - **Regular Inspections**: Periodically check the lawn for signs of weed encroachment, particularly during the warmer months when growth is rapid.\n   - **Healthy Lawn Practices**: Maintain consistent watering, mowing, and fertilization schedules to keep the lawn competitive and less susceptible to weed invasion.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can manage the roughstalk bluegrass infestation and maintain a healthier, more uniform lawn.",

                "answer": "Liverwort, also known as Marchantia, is a type of nonvascular plant that can be persistent and difficult to manage, especially when it grows in dense patches in garden areas like flower beds. The persistent growth you've experienced despite various treatments suggests that liverwort can be resilient to some common chemical and physical controls.\n\nHere are some recommended strategies to manage liverwort:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: \n   - Regularly hand-pick or dig out liverwort by hand, being careful not to spread it to other areas. This method is labor-intensive but effective in small areas.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Herbicides**: While not universally effective on liverwort, some herbicides may work. Products containing glyphosate (Roundup) have been used on liverwort in the past. However, because of its persistence and potential for spreading, repeated applications might be necessary.\n   - **Preemergence Herbicides**: Products like Preen can help prevent new liverwort from germinating if applied before the liverwort reproduces. However, they need to be applied before the liverwort has a chance to establish itself.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Aeration and Drainage**: Improve soil aeration and drainage, as liverwort often thrives in poorly drained, compacted soils. Adding organic matter such as compost can help improve soil structure.\n   - **Water Management**: Reduce water standing on the soil surface by using raised beds or improving water runoff.\n\n4. **Biological Control**:\n   - Some biological control agents, such as nematodes, have shown promise in controlling liverwort. These organisms can be applied directly to affected areas and may provide long-term suppression.\n\n5. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Use a combination of these methods rather than relying on one single approach. For example, use physical removal followed by chemical treatment to ensure all liverwort is eliminated.\n\n6. **Regular Monitoring**:\n   - Keep an eye on the areas where liverwort has been removed or controlled. Liverwort can regrow quickly, so regular inspections are essential to catch any new infestations early.\n\nGiven the persistence of liverwort, it's important to remain persistent with your efforts, possibly combining different strategies over time. It may also be beneficial to consult with a local horticulturist or agricultural extension office for more specific advice tailored to your location and conditions.",

You can also knock them into a shallow pan\u00a0of soapy water to drown them, or toss them into the edge of a field or woods to meet their fate if you don't want to directly kill them.

Perhaps there was a wisteria in that location before the patio was put in? The roots of a wisteria that has been cut down can keep sprouting for years. You can just keep cutting it back, and pulling it when you can, and eventually it will die of exhaustion, or you can use glyphosate to get at the roots.<br /> One caveat, if these roots are coming from a living wisteria nearby, glyphosate may well damage that plant too, and pulling won't exhaust it since it will keep getting energy from the mother plant. <br /> Good luck!",

I tested the branches below the foliage and found no green on either side,i.e. no green bark all around the plant. That is in contrast with the other 3\u00a0 each of which had green bark at the branch\u00a0 surface. below the foliage. I would rule out root rot due to conditions too wet since all 4 receive mostly rain water. But wait having written that\u00a0 a confession; when I do water plants during the dray times\u00a0 that particular box wood gets more water than the others So perhaps root rot may be a cause. It will be removed. <br /> \u00a0Without question all\u00a0 the boxwood\u00a0 plants are tight, very tight which I though was proper and sheering\u00a0was done yearly...

                "answer": "The image shows a cherry tree with ripe cherries that have started to fall off. This is likely due to natural maturation and the normal process of fruit drop as the tree prepares for harvest. However, if the fruit is falling off in excessive numbers or if there are signs of disease or pest damage, additional management strategies might be necessary.\n\n### Possible Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Monitor for Disease or Pests:**\n   - Check for signs of disease such as brown rot, anthracnose, or powdery mildew, which can cause premature fruit drop.\n   - Look for signs of pests like birds, squirrels, or cherry worms, which can also lead to fruit loss.\n\n2. **Supporting the Tree:**\n   - Ensure the tree is well-supported by pruning and training it correctly from the beginning. This helps in maintaining its structure and prevents branches from breaking under the weight of heavy fruit loads.\n   - Apply proper fertilization to ensure the tree has adequate nutrition, which can help strengthen the fruit and reduce the likelihood of premature drop.\n\n3. **Pruning:**\n   - Prune the tree annually to remove any dead, diseased, or\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684 branches. Proper pruning encourages good air circulation, which can reduce the risk of diseases.\n   - Remove any branches that are rubbing against each other or competing for resources, which can lead to stress and potential fruit drop.\n\n4. **Harvesting:**\n   - If you notice that fruit is dropping, consider harvesting the remaining fruits at an earlier stage when they are still firm but not yet fully ripe. This can sometimes prevent further fruit drop and improve the quality of the remaining fruits.\n   - Harvest the fruit while it is still firm to prevent more fruits from falling prematurely.\n\n5. **Watering and Soil Care:**\n   - Ensure the soil around the tree is well-drained and not waterlogged. Water the tree regularly during dry periods to maintain moisture levels, which can help support healthy growth and reduce stress on the tree.\n   - Mulching around the base of the tree can help retain moisture and reduce weed competition, which can also reduce stress on the tree.\n\n6. **Chemical Control (if necessary):**\n   - If you identify a specific disease or pest problem, consult with a local horticulturist or extension service for appropriate chemical controls.\n   - Be cautious with chemical applications, especially if the tree is heavily loaded with fruit. Overuse of chemicals can harm the tree and may not effectively control the issue.\n\nBy monitoring the tree",

                "answer": "The image shows a section of a tree trunk with a cut where the bark has been removed, revealing a healthy inner wood. This type of cut suggests that the tree may have been pruned or a branch was removed. However, the presence of lichen on the bark indicates that the tree is not actively growing or is stressed. Given the context provided (five cherry trees in Montgomery County, Maryland, in October 2017), it's important to consider several potential issues:\n\n1. **Disease or Insect Infestation**: The cut could be an attempt to address an issue such as a disease or insect infestation. If the tree is showing signs of stress, there might be a pathogen or pest that has compromised its health.\n\n2. **Nutrient Deficiency**: The tree could be lacking essential nutrients, which can lead to stress and susceptibility to diseases or pests.\n\n3. **Environmental Stressors**: Factors like drought, extreme weather, or environmental pollution can stress a tree and make it more susceptible to further damage.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Visual Inspection**:\n   - Conduct a thorough inspection of all affected trees to identify any visible signs of disease, insect infestations, or nutrient deficiencies.\n   - Look for signs of decay, discoloration, or unusual growth patterns that might indicate a problem.\n\n2. **Professional Consultation**:\n   - Contact a certified arborist or horticulturist for a professional assessment. They can provide a detailed diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatments based on the specific conditions observed.\n\n3. **Soil Testing**:\n   - Have the soil tested to check for nutrient levels and pH. This will help determine if the tree is lacking necessary nutrients and whether fertilization is needed.\n\n4. **Watering and Fertilization**:\n   - Ensure the trees receive adequate water during dry periods and\u9002\u91cf\u7684\u65bd\u80a5\u6765\u8865\u5145\u8425\u517b\u3002\n\n5. **Pruning and Maintenance**:\n   - If the cut appears to be from pruning, ensure that proper pruning techniques were used. Diseased or dead branches should be removed promptly to prevent the spread of disease.\n   - Keep the area around the base of the tree clear of debris and weeds to reduce competition for resources.\n\n6. **Chemical Control (if necessary)**:\n   - If a disease or insect infestation is identified, consider using appropriate chemical controls under the guidance of a professional. However, always follow the instructions carefully and consider the impact on the environment and local wildlife.\n\n7. **Monitoring**:\n   - Regularly",

There could also be a problem in the planting process. When the plants were installed, did you break up the root ball and fluff out the roots to help them get established in the soil? Sometimes the roots of container plants are so tightly bound in their pot and if the roots aren't teased out, they just do not get established well into the surrounding soil. Insufficient watering and/or mulch that is too deep can also contribute to the decline of new plants.<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/plants/tree-shrubs/tree-and-shrub-problems\">https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/plants/tree-shrubs/tree-and-shrub-problems</a><br><br>ckc<br>",

Over the last 7 years, the S/SW edge of the tree has lost all its bark - probably due to southwest injury.\u00a0Can you reccomend any treatment or wrapping that would be benefical to the tree?\u00a0</p>",

            "1": {
                "response": "Thanks for contacting the Jefferson County Extension Plant Diagnostics Master Gardener team.<br /> <br /> The damage to your plum tree trunk does appear to be 'sun scald,' which results from temperature fluctuations (day to night) during winter when the sun is at a low angle. It affects the south or southwest side of\u00a0soft-barked trees, including fruit trees, and for that reason wrapping tree trunks (Nov through March or early April) or painting the trunk (as in commercial orchards) is recommended. See CSU Fact sheet:\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/environmental-disorders-of-woody-plants-2-932/\">Environmental Disorders of Woody Plants - 2.932 - Extension (colostate.edu)</a><br /> <br /> Trees can usually recover from small bark cracks.\u00a0At this point, however, the damage is so severe that the vascular system on about half the tree is likely to be compromised to the point that the tree may not survive. This document from the University of Minnesota Extension explains how to repair a relatively small area of broken bark (cutting the bark back to allow it to re-grow evenly, not using any sort of wrap, and applying fungicide if the tree\u00a0is evidence susceptible to\u00a0fungus), but this does not seem practical due to the extent of damage on your tree's trunk:<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-news/sunscald-and-winter-dieback-shrubs#:~:text=If%20you%20need%20to%20repair%20sunscald%20damage%3A%201,is%20known%20to%20be%20susceptible%20to%20fungal%20diseases.\">Winter damage: Sunscald and winter dieback on deciduous shrubs | UMN Extension</a><br /> <br /> If the tree leafs out, it may survive; but it does not appear likely to replace the lost bark, as the problem appears to have been going on for several years,\u00a0so its health will continue to be fragile. Minimizing stress on the tree by avoiding fertilization and providing\u00a0proper irrigation (keeping the soil evenly moist throughout the growing season and watering monthly in winter) can help but there is no guarantee the tree will survive.<br /> <br /> Pat B",

Here are the key visual features:\n\n1. **Tree Trunk**: The central focus is the bark of the tree, which appears weathered and textured with cracks and crevices. The bark is dark brown to black, indicating age or exposure to the elements.\n\n2. **Mulch and Soil**: The ground around the base of the tree is covered with mulch, consisting of dried leaves, wood chips, and other organic matter. There are patches of bare soil visible as well.\n\n3. **Vegetation**: In the foreground, there are small green plants sprouting from the mulch, suggesting early growth in spring. Some twigs and branches are also scattered on the ground.\n\n4. **Fence**: Behind the tree, there is a wooden fence made of vertical planks. The fence appears aged and weathered, matching the rustic feel of the scene.\n\n5. **Sky and Background**: The sky is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day. There are some bare tree branches in the background, suggesting it might be early spring or late fall.\n\n6. **Time Stamp**: The time stamp on the image indicates it was taken at 17:03:39 on April 7, 2024, in Jefferson County, Colorado.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image suggests a quiet, natural environment, likely part of a residential or community garden area.",

                "answer": "The image shows a section of a young apple tree with significant bark damage or peeling, which could be indicative of various issues such as mechanical injury, disease, or poor pruning practices. Here are some steps to consider for managing this situation:\n\n1. **Assess the Damage**: Determine the extent of the damage. If the damage is superficial and limited to the outer bark, it may not pose a serious threat to the tree's health. However, if the damage extends into the inner bark (cambium layer) or deeper, it could disrupt the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.\n\n2. **Clean Wounds**: If the damage is recent, clean the affected area with a sterile knife or shears to remove any dead tissue. Avoid cutting too deeply; aim to leave a healthy margin around the damaged area.\n\n3. **Prune Carefully**: Ensure that you are not causing additional damage when pruning. Avoid cutting into the main trunk or major limbs, as this can lead to more extensive damage and increase the risk of disease entry.\n\n4. **Protect the Tree**: Apply a tree wound dressing or sealant to the cut areas to protect them from pathogens and promote healing. This can help reduce the likelihood of infection and aid in the healing process.\n\n5. **Monitor for Disease**: Keep an eye on the tree for signs of infection or disease, such as discoloration, wilting leaves, or the presence of insects. If disease symptoms appear, consult with a local horticulturist or arborist for appropriate treatment.\n\n6. **Fertilization and Watering**: Ensure the tree is receiving adequate nutrition and moisture. Young apple trees require regular watering and fertilization to support their growth and development.\n\n7. **Consider Professional Help**: If the damage appears extensive or the tree shows signs of stress or decline, consulting a professional arborist might be necessary. They can provide a more detailed assessment and recommend specific treatments tailored to the tree's needs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage the damage and potentially prevent further issues, ensuring the long-term health and vitality of your apple tree.",

There are two subspecies of northern watersnake in Ontario: the northern watersnake, Neroida sipedon sipedon and the Lake Erie watersnake, Nerodia sipedon insularum. \u00a0They are very difficult to distinguish. The location where you observed this particular snake can help determine the subspecies, however, because the Lake Erie watersnake is only found on the islands in western Lake Erie, including Pelee Island, but the northern watersnake does not inhabit these islands. \u00a0<br><br>The northern watersnake is common throughout its range, which extends from southern Ontario and southern Quebec to Texas and Florida in the U.S. Maximum length is approximately 5 feet, but typical length is around 3 feet.<br><br>If approached watersnakes will always try to escape, usually preferring to drop in the water and disappear. If cornered, they will flatten the front portion of their body to make themselves appear larger, and will strike repeatedly if you get to close. They do not like to be handled, and will discharge a strong-smelling musk from their anal glands and bite repeatedly, if you try to pick them up.<br><br>Here's a link to the Ontario Reptile and Amphibian Atlas where you can find descriptions of all the snake species that inhabit Ontario:<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ontarionature.org/protect/species/reptiles_and_amphibians/#snakes\">http://www.ontarionature.org/protect/species/reptiles_and_amphibians/#snakes</a><br><br>Hope\u00a0this information\u00a0helps, and\u00a0thanks\u00a0for\u00a0using\u00a0Ask\u00a0an Expert.<br><br>Jim<br>",

Here\u2019s a general management strategy you can follow:\n\n### 1. Check Watering Habits:\n   - **Overwatering**: Ensure the soil is not too wet. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Use a moisture meter if available.\n   - **Underwatering**: If the leaves are wilting, it may indicate that the plant is thirsty. Check the soil moisture regularly.\n\n### 2. Nutrient Deficiency:\n   - Ensure your plant is getting enough nutrients. Consider using a balanced houseplant fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).\n\n### 3. Pest Control:\n   - Inspect the leaves and stems for any signs of pests like spider mites or mealybugs. You might see white spots on the undersides of leaves or small webs.\n   - Treat with an insecticidal soap solution or neem oil if necessary.\n\n### 4. Light Exposure:\n   - Ensure the plant is receiving adequate light but avoid direct sunlight, especially if the leaves are showing signs of sunburn.\n\n### 5. Temperature and Humidity:\n   - Keep the plant in a location with stable temperatures. Avoid drafts from air conditioning or heating vents.\n\n### 6. Pruning and Maintenance:\n   - Trim off any yellowing or damaged leaves to promote new growth.\n   - Regularly clean the leaves with a soft cloth to remove dust and debris.\n\n### 7. Soil Quality:\n   - Use a well-draining potting mix designed for houseplants. Consider repotting the plant if the roots are tightly bound in the pot.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to address the issues affecting your money tree. If the problem persists, consider consulting a local horticulturist or plant specialist for more specific advice.",

                "answer": "The image shows a maple tree with significant browning and leaf dropping, which is concerning. Given the background information provided, here are the recommended management strategies to address the issue:\n\n1. **Watering**: Since the gardener indicated that the tree needed more water in the past, it's crucial to ensure consistent and adequate watering. Monitor the soil moisture regularly and adjust the watering schedule as needed. During dry periods, provide sufficient water to help the tree recover.\n\n2. **Fertilization**: Consider applying a balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for maples. This can help the tree regain its vigor and improve its overall health. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Pruning**: Although the neighbors trimmed the tree early this spring, it may be beneficial to have a professional arborist assess the tree for any necessary pruning. Proper pruning can help reduce stress on the tree and improve its structure.\n\n4. **Leaf Mulching**: Adding a layer of mulch around the base of the tree can help retain soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and suppress weeds. Ensure the mulch is kept at least 2-3 inches away from the trunk to prevent potential rot.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Management**: Inspect the tree for signs of pests or diseases. If issues are identified, take appropriate action such as using organic or chemical treatments as necessary. Contact a local horticulturist or extension office for guidance on managing specific problems.\n\n6. **Tree Health Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the tree for signs of improvement or further decline. Keep records of watering, fertilizing, and any treatments applied. This will help in making informed decisions about future care.\n\n7. **Elevated Planter Maintenance**: Ensure that the planter itself is well-draining. Excess water can lead to root rot, which is harmful to the tree. Check if the planter needs repotting or if there are signs of compaction that might impede proper drainage.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help the maple tree regain its health and vitality. If the problem persists, consider consulting with a professional arborist for further assessment and recommendations.",

Given that the tree was planted last year, it's important to address this issue promptly to ensure its health and growth. Here\u2019s a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Monitor the Tree**: Regularly inspect the tree for any signs of stress or further damage. Check for cracks in the bark, wilting leaves, or wilting branches.\n\n2. **Prevent Additional Damage**: Ensure that the area around the tree is clear of heavy machinery and other equipment that could cause further harm to the bark.\n\n3. **Apply Bark Protector**: If the bark is still in danger of being damaged, consider applying a protective material such as tree wrap or a natural burlap barrier around the trunk. This can help shield the bark from additional mechanical damage.\n\n4. **Watering**: Make sure the tree receives adequate water. Young trees need consistent moisture to establish their root system. Check the soil moisture regularly and water as needed.\n\n5. **Pruning**: If there are branches that have been damaged beyond repair, they may need to be pruned back. However, avoid excessive pruning, which can stress the tree.\n\n6. **Fertilization**: Use an appropriate fertilizer that is suitable for maple trees. Follow the recommended rates and application methods provided by a local horticulturist or garden center.\n\n7. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture and reduce weed competition. Avoid piling the mulch too close to the trunk to prevent rot.\n\n8. **Pest and Disease Management**: Keep an eye out for pests or diseases that might exploit the weakened condition of the tree due to the bark damage. Treat any issues promptly using organic or chemical treatments as necessary.\n\n9. **Support Structures**: If the bark damage is severe, consider wrapping the trunk with a protective barrier to prevent additional damage from wind or wildlife.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help the tree recover from the initial trauma and promote healthy growth. It's crucial to address the issue promptly to minimize potential long-term effects on the tree's health and vigor.",

The adults are moths.<br /> Cutworms are caterpillars that can be pests in gardens and on farms. They are especially tough on seedlings. Often, they will eat the base of seedling stems causing the young plants to fall over and die. That is how they got the name \"cutworm\".<br /> If you are growing young plants or a garden for food, you could eliminate those pupae to reduce numbers of the next generation of caterpillars. <br /> Hope that helps!",

Members of the genus Juniperus (like Eastern red cedar and juniper) are a host of one of the life stages,\u00a0like you are seeing now. The fungus doesn't really cause harm to cedars, but the spores from this stage are spread to apple, pear, quince, hawthorn, and related species where they can damage leaves and fruit. It is possible to prune out the fungus on the branches, but on large trees\u00a0there would almost certainly be infections on\u00a0areas that are out of reach for pruners. There is no practical way to manage it with chemicals. The best way to manage this disease is to plant varieties of apple, hawthorn, pear, ect\u00a0that are resistant to rust. Again, this will not damage the cedar.\n<br>Check out the links below for more information.<br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/rust-diseases-trees-and-shrubs\">https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/rust-diseases-trees-and-shrubs</a><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/trees-shrubs/cedar-apple-rust-and-gymnosporangium-rusts/\">https://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/trees-shrubs/cedar-apple-rust-and-gymnosporangium-r...</a><br>\n<br>",

                "answer": "The image shows a branch of a cedar tree with a large, orange, string-like growth that appears to be a type of fungus, possibly **Cedar Apple Rust** (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae). This fungus is known to infect various conifer species, including cedars, and can cause significant damage if left untreated.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Fungus**: Confirm the type of fungus present by consulting with a local extension agent or a professional arborist. Cedar Apple Rust can be identified by its distinctive orange fruiting bodies on the underside of leaves and branches during the spring and summer months.\n\n2. **Remove Infected Parts**: If the infection is localized, you may need to prune out the infected branches. Use clean, sharp pruning tools and disinfect them between cuts with rubbing alcohol or a 10% bleach solution to prevent spreading the fungus to other parts of the tree.\n\n3. **Prune for Ventilation**: After removing infected parts, prune the tree to improve air circulation around the remaining branches. Proper ventilation helps to reduce the humidity and moisture levels around the tree, which can slow the spread of the fungus.\n\n4. **Apply Fungicides**: Consider applying fungicides specifically designed to control Cedar Apple Rust. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions carefully, as improper application can harm the tree. Fungicides can help manage the spread of the fungus but should not be relied upon as a sole treatment method.\n\n5. **Monitor for Reoccurrence**: After treating the infected area, continue to monitor the tree closely. Cedar Apple Rust can reappear in subsequent years, especially if conditions favor its growth (high humidity, wet weather).\n\n6. **Maintain General Tree Health**: Ensure the overall health of the tree by providing adequate water, proper fertilization, and protection from pests and diseases. A strong, healthy tree is better equipped to resist fungal infections.\n\n7. **Consider Professional Advice**: If the infection is extensive or if the tree is stressed, it might be advisable to consult a professional arborist who can provide more tailored advice based on the specific condition of the tree.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage the issue and potentially prevent further damage to your cedar tree.",

                "response": "<p>This is a healthy stand of ground ivy (aka Creeping Charlie, Glechoma hederacea). It is an introduced perennial species that reproduces both by seed and stolons (above ground stems that root at the nodes).<br /> </p> <p><strong>In the lawn</strong>, probably the best herbicide for creeping Charlie is triclopyr, which is marketed as many things, like Ortho Weed B Gon Chickweed, Clover, and Oxalis Killer (which comes in a ready to use hose application form or a concentrate to mix). Other lawn products that target broadleaves and contain 2,4-d, dicamba, and/or mecoprop can also suppress this weed, but triclopyr is more effective.<br /> <br /> Here\u2019s some specific info on triclopyr:<br /> Triclopyr is a growth regulator/synthetic auxin herbicide (Group 4) that exhibits activity on annual and perennial broadleaf plants, vines, and woody plants and is most often used for control of brush and poison ivy in grass pastures, non-crop areas, right-of-ways, etc. <strong>Triclopyr will not injury grass when used at labeled rates.</strong> Triclopyr is absorbed primarily by the foliage of plants but can also be absorbed by cut stems and roots. Injury symptoms associated with low rates of exposure include distorted growth, leaf cupping, stem and petiole twisting, stem swelling, chlorosis of the growing points, wilting, and eventual tissue death (necrosis). The death of the plant can take several weeks and in the case of well established perennials like this, it may take more than one application. <br /> <br /> Triclopyr, like other Group 4 herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D, dicamba, mecoprop, etc.), is susceptible to movement via drift and volatilization, particularly when conditions are hot (85F+) and dry and/or breezy (winds greater than 7-10 mph). This is where you\u2019d want to be careful to avoid injury to ornamentals nearby....usually it is lower growing things like vegetable gardens next to lawns is where we see issues with 2,4-d and dicamba. I believe that triclopyr is less volatile than both dicamba and 2,4-d. Triclopyr is mobile with water movement that occurs shortly after application (such as precipitation events and irrigation), so applying when dry weather is expected for several days would be advised to avoid it moving with water to unwanted areas.<br /> <br /> Re-entry into treated areas by people and pets can occur once the product has dried (or according to the label if it specifies a different interval).<br /> </p> <p>Always be sure to read and follow all labeled directions to ensure maximum effectiveness and personal and environmental safety.<br /> </p> <p>After you have achieved your desired level of control the work isn\u2019t over. You need to do two important things. 1) Make sure you have a robust/vigorous stand of grass in your lawn to create a competitive environment for weeds. Practices could include re-seeding areas where the grass stand is thin, fertilizing the grass (early-spring and/or early-fall), watering when conditions are dry, and increasing your mowing height (~3.5\", this last one will not help with tall fescue but will help with broadleaves and stress management). 2) You need to be on the lookout for weeds emerging from seed. Some weeds can linger as seeds in the \u201cseed bank\u201d of the soil for decades! Controlling these weeds could include the use of a preemergence herbicide (e.g. products targeting crabgrass control) or manual removal of emerged plants.

For these types of\u00a0herbicides to most effective the target plant needs to be actively growing. We usually say that is when average temperatures are at or above 50F. Another way I like to think about it, once the grass is growing and people are mowing consistently, that is a good indicator that a herbicide will be absorbed and effectively moved throughout the plant to maximize effectiveness (and save you time and money).\u00a0",

                "response": "Given the proximity to desirable perennial plants, spot treatment with glyphosate alone or in combination with the non-permeable plastic barrier is likely the best option. Glyphosate is a systemic herbicide, so it will move within the plant for a more complete kill, unlike the boiling water and the more natural herbicide you mentioned earlier which only kill contacted tissue.  The other advantage of glyphosate is that it has no activity once it reaches the soil due to binding with organic matter and clay particles and therefore replanting area is not an issue. Spot treating can be done by painting the herbicide on the goutweed using a sponge, brush, or rag to avoid drifting spray on to desired plants. There is also a product out called Roundup Precision Gel that looks like an oversized stick of deodorant that is designed for very targeted applications. Glyphosate is most\neffective for perennial control in the fall but can be applied anytime the\nplants are actively growing (temperatures consistently above 50F). Repeat applications with glyphosate may be necessary given the level of establishment that this population appears to have. <br><br>When using products containing glyphosate there are a few\nimportant points to consider. First, as with any pesticide, remember to read\nand follow all labeled instructions. Second, glyphosate is a broad-spectrum\nherbicide, meaning it will injure or kill other plants contacted during the application, so care is needed to avoid green plant material, exposed roots,\nand injured bark of desired plants. Third, be sure that the product you choose\nhas only the active ingredient glyphosate or glyphosate + pelargonic acid.\nProducts with additional active ingredients may have other unwanted effects and\nmay delay the planting of other plants in the coming season(s).<br><br><br><br>",

I have been seeing the insects in the attached pictures in my bathroom sink around the drain and also on the tiled bathroom floor near the toilet and shower.  The insects are about the size of a grain of fine-ground pepper and they might be mistaken for a fleck of dirt if they didn't move.  \n\nAny ideas what these little beasties are, what is attracting them, and how I might be able to get rid of them?  Also, they don't seem to fly, but they do jump.  Could they be the source of the bites that are driving me mad?\n\nAny help or guidance you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated!

                "answer": "The image shows a small insect on a leaf of a plant that appears to be a rose bush. Given the context provided, it seems like the insect may be a pest affecting the rose bushes. Here's a recommended management strategy for the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Pest**: The insect in the image resembles a sawfly, which can be a common pest for roses. Sawflies lay their eggs on the leaves or stems of the plants, and the larvae feed on the leaves, causing significant damage.\n\n2. **Physical Removal**: If the infestation is light, you can manually remove the insects by picking them off the leaves and stems. This method is effective for small populations but impractical for larger infestations.\n\n3. **Use Insecticidal Soap**: For a more targeted approach, you can use insecticidal soap. This is a natural solution that disrupts the insect's waxy coating, leading to dehydration and death. Apply it as directed on the rose leaves and stems.\n\n4. **Introduce Beneficial Insects**: Encourage the presence of beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings, which prey on pests like sawflies. These beneficial insects can help control the population naturally.\n\n5. **Apply Neem Oil**: Neem oil is another natural option that can be applied to the affected areas. It acts as a pesticide and also deters the insects from laying eggs.\n\n6. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the rose bushes regularly to monitor the pest levels and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Early detection is key to managing pests effectively.\n\n7. **Maintain Plant Health**: Ensure the rose bushes are well-watered and fertilized to maintain their overall health. Healthy plants are better equipped to resist pest infestations.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to manage the sawfly infestation on your rose bushes effectively.",

The leaves are green with spots that could indicate various conditions such as pest infestation, disease, or nutrient deficiency. Some of the leaf edges are curled and appear to be damaged, possibly from being eaten by insects or due to environmental stress. The background is a dark brown surface, likely a wooden table or bench.\n\nThe overall condition of the plant suggests it may require care, such as monitoring for pests, ensuring adequate watering and light, and potentially applying a fertilizer if nutrient deficiencies are suspected.

The large bare  spot on IMG_2092 shows the space left by many dead branches that died this spring as well as a few new dead branches. How can I arrest this gradual die-off?  These images were taken after i pruned it in may this year.\nHistory: For many years the azalea suffered from lace-bugs (on which a soap spray didn't work) which I controlled with malathion.  About four years ago, I had to treat a nearby dwarf Alberta spruce with Bayer 3-in-1 insect control and found that it also controlled the lace bugs so I discontinued the malathion. The azalea gets full sun in the afternoon. The soil is not compacted.  It's been pruned by hand into the ball shape you see, cutting the shoots and about every 5 years more severely to control size--always by hand,  The azalea was purchased from, and planted by a local (Howard County) nursery.

Here are some steps you can consider as a management strategy:\n\n1. **Identify the Issue**: Determine whether the problem is due to a disease (like apple scab, rust, or blight) or pests (such as aphids, caterpillars, or borers). Observing the leaves, branches, and overall health of the tree will help in identifying the specific issue.\n\n2. **Prune the Tree**: Remove any dead or diseased branches to prevent the spread of infection and improve air circulation around the tree. This can help reduce the risk of further damage from diseases.\n\n3. **Apply Fertilizer**: Ensure the tree is well-nourished. A balanced fertilizer can provide essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are crucial for healthy growth and disease resistance.\n\n4. **Use Organic Controls**: If the issue is identified as a pest infestation, consider using organic controls such as neem oil or insecticidal soap. These products are effective against many pests and are safer for the environment compared to chemical pesticides.\n\n5. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the tree regularly for signs of reoccurrence of the issue. Early detection and intervention can help manage the problem more effectively.\n\n6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If the issue persists despite your efforts, it may be beneficial to consult with a local horticulturist or arborist who can provide more specific advice based on the location and type of issue observed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can manage the issue effectively and ensure the health and longevity of your pear tree.",

                "response": "<p>Thanks for your question.</p> <p>As you correctly surmised, this is an Eastern Bumble Bee (Bombus impatiens). It is the most common bumble bee in Minnesota. They nest underground so it is not surprising that you found them near your siding which is, presumably, very close to the ground. They generally are rather passive but if provoked or if they suspect their territory is being intruded upon, they will attack and sting. Look at their name: they are \u201cimpatient\u201d when it comes to defending their territory. The stings are momentarily painful but certainly not serious. Just apply a watery mixture of baking soda and water to the area and the pain will quickly dissipate. The other thing to keep in mind is that once the cooler temperatures of October arrive, you will not see these critters any more. They will have all died. My advice is to just give them a wide berth for the next few weeks. After that you will not see them anymore. It is extremely unlikely that they will return next spring (2023) to this same area. Also please keep in mind that in their comings and goings at this time, they are serving an extremely important role as plant pollinators.

There is a minor problem on the east side (5%).  do not know if this is insect or other damage. \n\nOnly one of several cut open did contain a single larvae.  One, pictures sent, had a spent cocoon attached to it.  The rest that I have cut open look like the \"interior\" picture sent to Mary Kay.\n\nImpression is that once the 2012 needles drop the west side of the trees will be completely bare.  See \"Possible 2012 Damage\".  Assume this will eventually kill the trees?\n\nWes Earp",

This excerpt from the Pennsylvania State University bulletin we brought to your attention addresses the subject in more detail:<br><p>\"There are three chemical herbicides available to control grape. \nDicamba can be applied as a foliar spray, basal bark, or spot \napplication. Fosamine herbicide works as a foliar spray. 2,4-D herbicide\n can be used as a selective treatment when applied as a stump treatment,\n basal bark spray, or tree injection. Caution must be taken when using \nany of these herbicides, because they will kill non-target broad-leaf \nunder-story plants, seedlings, and saplings.</p>\n<p>The preferred method of grape control is by mechanical means. \nSevering the vines one to two feet about the ground works as a very \neffective control methods as long as the vines are growing under\na forest canopy. After cutting, the vine will likely resprout. However, \nthe sprouts and entire plant will die within three years, if in heavy \nshade. This method works because grape is shade intolerant. If this \nmethods is tried in a young stand when the trees are under 18 feet tall \nand the forest floor receives a large amount of sunlight, the grape \nsprouts may be able to grow back into the tree crowns.\"</p><br><br>",

The signs of recent cutting include visible cuts on the trunks and branches, as well as the presence of liquid exuding from these cuts, which is consistent with the description of the grapevine species.\n\nGiven the background information, the issue seems to be the spread and potential impact of the grapevine species on other trees. Here are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: Manually remove any remaining grapevines. Ensure that all roots and shoots are removed to prevent regrowth. This can be time-consuming but is effective if done thoroughly.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**: Use herbicides specifically designed for control of invasive plants such as grapevines. These products can be applied directly to the cut surfaces to kill the plant tissue and prevent the spread of roots. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions carefully.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Establish and maintain healthy native vegetation around the affected areas. This can help compete with the grapevines and reduce their ability to thrive.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Prevention**: Regularly monitor the area for any new growth of grapevines. Preventive measures, such as maintaining a buffer zone free of grapevines, can help manage the spread.\n\n5. **Community Efforts**: Engage local residents and landowners in managing the invasive species. Collaboration can lead to more comprehensive and effective control efforts.\n\n6. **Regulatory Actions**: Report the issue to local authorities or environmental agencies responsible for managing invasive species. They may have additional resources or regulations that can help address the problem.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help mitigate the negative impacts of grapevines on your property and the surrounding environment.",

        "question": "A friend of mine grows basil indoors in a somewhat enclosed terrarium.  Lately he has noticed a lot of bugs as he describes in the quote of his email below.  Attached are 3 photos that may help in identification of the insect.  My thinking is that they may be fruit flies and I know how to create the vinegar and soap in a jar trap to kill the adults if they are fruit flies.  My thinking is also that the damp soil may be the breeding ground.  If so, how would one safely kill the eggs and larvae and still be able to eat the basil?\n\nQuote: \"As far as I can tell there aren\u2019t any nibbles on the leaves. It\u2019s more of they\u2019re just a nuisance to see. I got a photo of the larva form of them which do have red eyes. They\u2019re white grubs with red eyes in that form. \n\nI would say when they\u2019re in their fly form they flit about. They don\u2019t really fly that much. The fly looking ones have teeny tiny legs. And if it helps I only see them on the underside of the leaves. They\u2019re never on top of the leaves. That could just be coincidence by I don\u2019t know. \n\nThey\u2019re only between the plastic wrap and the window. No where else in the house.\n\nThe basil is in the front bay window of the house so not in the kitchen where all the other food is.\"\n",

The drip is over the garage.  Roots have migrated thru the humus on the rock.\r\n\r\nI started watering this maple last summer (despite a ban - evil me).  I have been watering (maybe 3x so far this summer) with an overhead sprinkler that may have hit where this mystery substance is growing.  So this could be something that grew in the heavily shaded, wet, not the best drainage area.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it was a long forgotten dog pile I missed.  But when I picked it out of my rock swifter, it was squishy.  Then I thought the contractors cleaned off some white silicon in that area because that was the texture this was.  But I just kept uncovering more.  It even started to cover rocks themselves.\r\n\r\nThe tree provides fabulous shade for the house.  It's between multiple utilities lines coming into 2 houses.  So I don't want to lose this tree let alone pay to have it removed.\r\n\r\n1 - Do I need to worry about the maple or do some type of preventative care.  I haven't found it in other areas around the tree.  Just next to the garage.\r\n\r\n2 -  Can I use the rocks around some hostas in a egress window well?",

It\u2019s caused by high pH in your soil, which in turn causes an iron deficiency. If the pH is above about 7.5-7.7, the iron gets tied up chemically and is not available to the plant, even though there still could be iron present in the soil.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible to correct the underlying soil pH problem by applying elemental sulfur or acidifying fertilizers.

Over-fertilization can cause root burn or other issues. If you suspect over-fertilization, consider flushing the soil with water to leach out excess nutrients.\n\n4. **Evaluate Watering System**: Ensure that the sprinkler system is functioning correctly and providing adequate moisture to the roots. Root damage from over-watering or under-watering can also affect the health of the tree. Adjust watering if necessary to match the tree's needs.\n\n5. **Prune for Health**: Prune dead or diseased branches to improve air circulation and reduce the risk of disease.

Your mint is not suffering from poor soil but more likely a leaf sucking pest like\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/leafhoppers-flowers\">leaf hoppers</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/spider-mites-vegetables\">spider mites</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watch-thrips-and-mites-vegetables\">thrips</a>, etc. These pests suck the chlorophyll from the leaves, leaving white spots on the leaf surface. <br /><br />Thrips will leave behind little black specks of frass (bug droppings) and often distort new leaf growth, so I doubt that is your pest, going by your photos.\u00a0And, while there's not much to do about leaf hoppers, mites can be treated fairly easily. First, they like it hot and dry (which we've seen a lot of lately). By hosing down the plant regularly -- especially the undersides of the leaves -- you'll change their preferred environment and, possibly, create an environment that invites predatory/beneficial mites in, which will feed on the pest mites. You could also use an insecticidal soap, but only on mildly damaged leaves. Water in the evening and use the insecticidal soap in the early morning, when the plant is fully hydrated and the least stressed. If you fertilize, hold off for a while. Mites love excess nitrogen.<br /><br />If your plant is heavily damaged, which it doesn't appear to be in your photos but things can change rapidly, removing and disposing of the plant is your best option to prevent spread. Be sure to clean up and dispose of\u00a0all fallen plant debris as well.<br /><br />I hope this helps, let us know if we can assist further.</p>",

It resembles a juniper, and usually has the same diseases and insects as a Juniper but it is a Cypress. </p> <p>After looking at your pictures, It appears that you might have more than one problem. First, in the third picture, you definitely have scale. The scale crawlers appear in the spring, adhering to needles to begin feeding on plant juices. Scale covering can remain attached to the needles for several years. Severely-infested plants turn yellowish-brown and the plant appears to be in need of fertilizer or water. Plants can decline due to scale feeding over time and may be killed by severe infestations. Treatment needs to occur during the spring, when crawlers are moving.</p> <p>I have included several references on how to treat your cypress and when.</p> <p><a href=\"https://datcpservices.wisconsin.gov/pb/pests.jsp?categoryid=43&amp;articleid=2376&amp;issueid=304\">https://datcpservices.wisconsin.gov/pb/pests.jsp?categoryid=43&amp;articleid=2376&amp;issueid=304</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bygl.osu.edu/node/697\">https://bygl.osu.edu/node/697</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/juniper_scale_crawlers_are_active_in_michigan\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/juniper_scale_crawlers_are_active_in_michigan</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/juniper-and-minute-cypress-scales\">https://extension.psu.edu/juniper-and-minute-cypress-scales</a></p> <p>Second, it appears that some of the plant that does not have scale, could have Phomopsis Tip Blight. This disease is caused by the fungus Phomopsis juniperovora and begins by infecting the tips of branches smaller than the diameter of a pencil. The new, immature growth becomes infected while the darker green, mature foliage remains resistant to infection</p> <p>I have included several references concerning this disease also (and remember, that junipers and cypress do have similar diseases and insect problems):</p> <p><a href=\"https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/juniper-diseases-insect-pests/\">https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/juniper-diseases-insect-pests/</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/phomopsis-tip-blight/#:~:text=Phomopsis%20tip%20blight%20is%20caused,moisture%20or%20humidity%20is%20high\">https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/phomopsis-tip-blight/#:~:text=Phomopsis%20tip%20blight%20is%20caused,moisture%20or%20humidity%20is%20high</a>.</p> <p>Usually, a shrub will have multiple problems when it is stressed. The shrubs look older, but if they are not mulched, have consistent dry or wet roots, and not getting enough sun (4-8 hours for these plants), that could put them into stress mode, and make them more susceptible to diseases and insects. Before treating, check to see if the plants have any of these issues, and if you can do something to help eliminate some of the stress. </p>",

(Such herbicides will also kill any other grass the spray coats.)<br /> <br /> If a physical barrier like garden edging or solid fencing can't be used along the property line to keep the zoysia from creeping into the yard, it will be difficult to manage the problem long-term because physical or chemical\u00a0removal may be your only recourse. Although keeping a cool-season lawn (fescue, usually) vigorous and dense can help out-compete most weeds, zoysia will likely\u00a0be tough enough to hold its own against your lawn, making this approach not as reliable as it can be with other weeds like crabgrass. Some herbicides are selective towards certain weeds, but a chemical targeting one type of grassy weed (warm-season) among cool-season grass may be hard to find or use successfully. Unfortunately the opposite situation, having a cool-season grass mingling unwanted with a warm-season grass like zoysia, is easier to chemically treat since the zoysia will be dormant when the cool-season grass resumes growth\u00a0(and when it will be vulnerable to herbicide). The reverse doesn't really happen though, since zoysia is in active growth in summer and fescue is not, <em>but</em> the fescue doesn't tend to go fully dormant with respect to having all of the foliage die (since foliage absorption is how those root-killing herbicides work).<br /> <br /> Miri",

        "question": "Hello - I've had a weeping blue spruce specimen tree off my patio for 20 years.  It (was) an incredibly beautiful tree for quite awhile and is currently about 20 foot tall.  One day the tree developed Needle Cast, and over a period of 2 years I was able to effectively treat the tree with a fungicide spray.  It hasn't dropped a needle all season - although the tree has lost much of it's mass.  I hadn't noticed in all the time the tree was stressed out that it also developed Pitch Mass Borer on the underside, which started dropping Sap onto my AC unit.  Davey tree Company figured out what it was and recommended I purchase a product called Tenguard and treat the tree in Spring and Fall - their words: &quot;Spring and fall, the newly hatched larvae stays in the crevices of the bark. The goal is to spray them before they bore into the trunk.&quot;  I really want to save the tree and have the means and equipment to do it, so I purchased the product.  The infestation is too high up to reach physically, so I have to spray.  (BTW - I also drenched the soil with a systemic insecticide for long term caution called Dominion XL.  As well, a few weeks ago I sprayed the tree with Tenguard and the infestation seemed to stop for a few weeks but now it's back of course, because it was just a temporary fix in the middle of summer.   My question is when is the best time in Ohio to spray the larvae, and if successful, how long may it take to rid the tree of this infestation?",

The general recommendation is to keep the tree healthy and avoid mechanical injury to the tree. It is also recommended to remove the pitch masses and dispose of them in the trash as they often contain the larvae. This will keep their numbers down.\u00a0Spraying for the pitch mass borer is difficult because the larvae is located in the pitch mass or hidden in and\u00a0under the bark and the spray will not come in contact with the caterpillar.\u00a0That being said, spraying is more effective in the spring when the larvae are moving on the tree trunk. There was no mention of treatment with a systemic chemical in any article that I read.</p> <p>Before you commit to a chemical treatment, it is important to get an accurate identification of the insect that is invading your tree.\u00a0 If you can find evidence of the larvae inside of a pitch mass or the moth itself on the tree,\u00a0it would be a good idea to send a sample to the C. Wayne Ellett Plant and Pest Diagnostic Clinic,\u00a0run by the Ohio State University.\u00a0The PPDC can confirm the identification of the pest\u00a0and make additional recommendations for up to date management and treatment. If you should decide to treat the borer with a chemical, make sure that you follow all label directions accurately. Additionally, some chemicals are restricted and\u00a0need to be applied only by a certified pesticide applicator.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in recent years, the Colorado Blue Spruces planted in Ohio have\u00a0become increasingly stressed by the area's climate. The Blue Spruce does not do well with extreme winter temperature fluctuations, summer heat and humidity, and prolonged periods of rainy weather.\u00a0As they age, the spruces' defense mechanisms weaken and they begin to be riddled with disease and pests.\u00a0</p> <p>I have listed the links for the articles below. I have also listed a link for the PPDC's website if you would like to send a sample to them.

The curling of the leaves also points to aphids.\u00a0</p> <p>There are two options for control.</p> <p>1. Cultural control-\u00a0Spray the aphids with a strong stream of water. Be sure to get underneath the leaves. I recommend starting with this to see if it is enough control.\u00a0Most of the aphids should move to alternate hosts by mid-summer, so this should only be a temporary problem. Water may provide enough control until then.<br /></p> <p>2. Chemical control with insecticides- This may or may not be a good idea depending on your situation. The recommended pesticides are toxic to bees. They can also kill the natural enemies of the aphids. It can also be difficult to get the chemicals underneath the leaf curls.</p> <p>To prevent the problem in future, be sure to not over fertilize with nitrogen and to not over water. These cause succulent growth, which is exactly what aphids like.<br /></p> <p>Resources:</p> <p><a href=\"http://pnwhandbooks.stage.extension.oregonstate.edu/insect/tree-fruit/cherry/cherry-black-cherry-aphid\">Cherry-Black cherry aphid | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (oregonstate.edu)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/nurspest/insects/black-cherry-aphid\">Black cherry aphid | College of Agricultural Sciences (oregonstate.edu)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://treefruit.wsu.edu/crop-protection/opm/black-cherry-aphid/\">Black Cherry Aphid | WSU Tree Fruit | Washington State University</a></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Regards,</p> <p>Leo Sherry</p> <p>OSU Extension Master Gardener Volunteer</p>",

                "response": "It looks like you have blossom end rot.  This is a physiological disorder that is not caused by a pest or disease but rather is due to low levels of calcium in the fruit.  Control of blossom end rot is dependent upon maintaining adequate supplies of moisture and calcium to the developing fruits.  \n\nSymptoms can occur at any time during fruit development and are apparent one the end of the fruit opposite the stem.  In the beginning you will see a small water soaked spot appear which enlarges as the fruit develops.  Over time this will usually darken and turn leathery.  All of this occurs because alarge amount of calcium  is needed for normal cell growth.  During rapid fruit growth if the cells do not get enough calcium, then the fruit doesn't grow correctly and blossom end rot occurs.  The low levels of calcium may be due to low levels in the soil, drought, excessive moisture or fluctuations between high and low levels of water.  All of these reduce calcium uptake in the plant.  \n\nMaking sure you have adequqte calcium in your soil is a good first defense, so make sure to get a soil test and add nutrients as recommended.  Also, when you plant tomatoes early in cold soil blossom end rot is likely to develop on the first fruits, with the severity of the disease often subsiding on fruits set later.  So, planting tomatoes in warmer soils helps to alleviate the problem.  To help limit water fluctuations having irrigation is helpful.  Mulching of the soil is often helpful in maintaining adequate supplies of soil water in times of moisture stress.   Here is link to a fact sheet from Cornell University of blossom end rot as well. http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_BlossRt.htm\n",

In most cases it isn't a major health concern to the tree and new growth will push out the older leaves - if they are still attached- as the season progresses. Usually the symptoms clear up with weather changes into the summer too. It will not transfer to the turf grass.</p> <p>It helps trees to recover if you can lesson their stress symptoms. With the drought weather and going into the summer, if you can supplement watering when it doesn't rain, that should help as well. Water deeply so it can soak into the entire root zone of the tree.</p> <p>To be proactive for next year, you can rake up and discard any fallen leaves which will help with the overwintering of the disease and also make sure to rake and dispose of leaves this fall as well.</p> <p>You shouldn't need to use additional fertilizer and this could be excessive. The tree is capable of getting enough nutrients from the area soils anyways. If you use leaf litter (that is not infected with anthracnose) or mulch once a year to help keep soil moisture and add decomposing organic matter back into the root area, that is usually sufficient.</p> <p>Let us know if you have further questions with this.<br /></p> <p>Emily</p>",

Wet spring weather is ideal for the development of this disease and we have had a lot of questions about this recently. Both a fungus and a bacterium can cause shot hole disease in cherries, and distinguishing between the two pathogens is challenging. Neither will be controlled by sprays applied after symptoms have progressed to this point. Some defoliation also occurs as a result of this condition.<br><br>The good news is that trees produce many more leaves than they need to feed themselves via photosynthesis, and in most cases mature trees can sustain some of this damage and recover in future years. No treatment is recommended. Remove and dispose of fallen leaves to reduce fungal inoculum around the planting area.

            "1": {
                "response": "The white spots on your zinnia leaves are caused by a very common fungal disease called powdery mildew. This disease may detract from the appearance of your zinnias, but it does very little damage. Fungal spores are spread from one plant to another by wind or splashing water.\u00a0Powdery mildew fungi thrive with cool, humid nights that stimulate spore production and warm (70 to 80 F), dry days that allow for spore spread.<br /> <br /> There's not a lot you can do to change the weather--the onset of cooler nights in the autumn contributes to the prevalence of this disease; however, there are a couple of things you can do to minimize this disease next year:<br /> <br /> 1. Space your plants far enough apart to provide good air circulation.<br /> <br /> 2. Avoid overhead watering, as water remaining on the plants contributes to the damp environment many powdery mildews need to spread.<br /> <br /> 3. Destroy all infected plant material at the end of this year's growing season (do not compost). <br /> <br /> 4. Look on seed packets for resistant zinnia varieties next year.<br /> <br /> Fungicides are available to help prevent the spread of powdery mildew once it is noticed on your plants; however, fungicides will not \"cure\" the plants of this disease. It generally is not necessary to use a fungicide if you follow the suggestions above.<br /> <br /> Here is some additional information on powdery mildew:<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/powdery-mildew-flower-garden\">https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/powdery-mildew-flower-garden</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ",

I've attached a photo of one of the leaves I picked up on the ground.\r\nIs this due to the late freeze that we had?  Have you seen this damage before?  Do I need to get an arborist to check out the health of the tree?  FYI, the tree is less than 20 years old.\r\nI actually live in the Fulton Heights Neighborhood area, less than 2 miles from your extension office.\r\nThanks so much for any assistance you can provide!",

                "response": "I have indeed seen this before, and no, you do not need to consult an arborist nor is it caused by recent frosts. <br /><br />This is a fungal disease called maple anthracnose and is generally only a cosmetic issue. Under ideal conditions, however, the disease can be severe, leading to premature defoliation and contributing to decline when other diseases and/or insect pests are present. Healthy trees may undergo defoliation in spring shortly after leaf out but are able to flush a new set of foliage and recover. Young trees are more susceptible to lasting damage while older, established trees typically suffer only minor growth losses. <br /><br />Anthracnose fungi overwinter within leaf tissue and in infected twigs and buds. In the spring, fruiting bodies are produced and spores are spread by wind and splashing rainwater. Infected leaves are the primary source of inoculum and should be removed<br /> from the site and destroyed (not composted). If the disease is severe, infected shoots should be pruned out, as they can also harbor the pathogen. This sanitation practice is the most important management step you can take and will reduce the amount of spores present to infect new leaves and shoots the following spring. <br /><br />Maintaining tree vigor through adequate fertilization, watering, <br />mulching and pruning will help lessen the impacts of the disease. <br /><br />The link below will give you some additional information.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/maple_leaf_blister_and_anthracnose_two_foliar_diseases_that_can_appear_on_s\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/maple_leaf_blister_and_anthracnose_two_foliar_diseases_that_can_appear_on_s</a><br /><br />",

As the trees in your yard mature their\ncanopies are growing closer together and reducing the amount of sunlight\nreaching the tree\u2019s lower branches. Spruce trees need full sunlight and will\ngrow poorly in shade. \u00a0The spruce tree\nmay not be getting enough sunlight to support the lower branches. \u00a0Prune out the dead wood. Spruce\ntrees that are grown in crowded settings with poor air circulation are often\npredisposed to fungus infections. \u00a0Some\nfungus infect the needles on the lower branches of the tree first and move\nupwards into the tree canopy.

        "question": "The accompanying photo shows a bare patch, roughly ellipsoidal, surrounding my front yard bird feeder. I added hardwood chips to the path (lower left) leading to the ellipsoidal area as well as to the area itself. The results were not what I had expected, so I've since removed all the chips. The bare spot is not very pleasing visually, so I'd like to rejuvenate the soil, which I suspect has experienced a shift in pH and/or other possibly deleterious changes. Your suggestions about how to effect this would be most welcome. I'm not necessarily wed to planting grass seed and/or overlaying sod, so I'm wondering if you can recommend some low-growing, ornamental grasses or other plants requiring less constant tending than turf grass to help transform this \"arid\" patch. Many thanks and happy holidays!  For the record, I was facing NNE to take this photo, so principal sun exposure (5-6 hrs. daily) comes from the right side of the view.",

It could take years for the toxins to break down and wash away. \u00a0We do not have any research on what plants can withstand sunflower seed toxins. Established shrubs seem to do better. \u00a0Planting large shrubs may also be successful. Some people have switched to shelled sunflower seed to avoid this problem.\u00a0<br><br>You may not be able to be much to grow under and near the birdfeeder. If you want to keep using sunflower seed, you may want to make a purposeful oval or other pleasing shape of mulch to make the bare area fit in your landscape better. A paver or brick/stone edging will make it look tidy. \u00a0The constant scratching of squirrels and pecking of birds also disrupts plant growth and makes new plantings problematic.

                "answer": "The image shows a yard with multiple squirrels actively moving around, likely attracted by the bird feeder which is visible on the left side of the image. The ground appears bare in some areas where the previous layer of hardwood chips has been removed, exposing soil that may be attracting squirrels due to its accessibility and potential food sources.\n\nGiven these observations, here are some recommended management strategies:\n\n1. **Provide Alternative Food Sources**: Introduce feeders specifically designed for birds or other small animals to reduce the attractiveness of the bird feeder to squirrels. This can help deter them from raiding birdseed.\n\n2. **Use Squirrel-Proof Feeders**: There are various types of feeders designed to prevent squirrels from accessing the seeds. Some models use a baffle system, while others have hinged lids or spinners that rotate to keep squirrels at bay.\n\n3. **Install a Feeder Guard**: A metal cage or netting around the feeder can protect it from squirrels. The cage should extend several feet below the feeder to prevent squirrels from reaching the seed.\n\n4. **Eliminate Attractive Elements**: Ensure that there is no food or water source (other than the intended bird feeder) that could attract squirrels. This includes removing any spilled food or birdseed from the ground.\n\n5. **Maintain the Area**: Regularly clean up any fallen seeds or bird droppings to keep the area tidy and less appealing to squirrels.\n\n6. **Consider Physical Barriers**: Installing a physical barrier like a fence around the perimeter of the garden can help prevent squirrels from accessing certain areas. However, this should be used as a last resort, as it might disturb the natural habitat and behavior of wildlife.\n\n7. **Educate Neighbors**: If multiple gardens in the neighborhood are experiencing similar issues, sharing information and solutions can help collectively manage the problem.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can create an environment that is less attractive to squirrels while still being welcoming to birds and other wildlife.",

The stems, \nleaves, and buds can be affected by both diseases. However, with \nPhytophthora blight, there is no felty growth or sporulation on the \nplant surface when in a wet environment. Infected parts become dark \nbrown or black and somewhat leathery. The entire shoot may turn black \nand die (Figure 2). Cankers may appear along the stems and cause them to\n fall over. While Botrytis sp seldom invades the crown, Phytophthora sp \noften does, causing a wet rot to develop and destroy the entire plant. \nBecause infections of this disease generally occur in the roots and \nlower portions of the stem, spraying with fungicides is of little value.\n Confirmed cases should be removed and destroyed, together with adjacent\n soil. Planting healthy clumps in new locations where the soil is well \ndrained usually prevents further trouble.</p><br>",

Planted into ground about 3 weeks ago hoping this would help but all the plants seen to have some fading/silvering/browning than dying leaves.\r\nI would like to know what is causing this. If there is a treatment, or if I need to remove them due to potential spreading   to other fruit plant?",

Recent transplants are susceptible to sunburn like this especially if they go from greenhouse or shade into direct sun. To prevent this in the future you can use a white shade cloth until the plants are adapted to the new conditions. For now, I think the growing points should be ok and there is nothing you can do other than take good care of them watering as needed this summer.\u00a0",

                "answer": "The image shows a large number of insects, likely boxelder bugs (Boisea trivittata), clustered on the leaves of Hostas in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Boxelder bugs are typically not harmful to plants and do not cause significant damage unless there is an extremely large population. However, their presence can be unsightly and may necessitate control measures if they become a nuisance.\n\nHere are some recommended management strategies for dealing with boxelder bugs on Hostas:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: Gently pick off the insects by hand and dispose of them in soapy water. This method works best for small populations.\n\n2. **Vacuuming**: Use a vacuum cleaner to remove the insects from the leaves. Be sure to empty the vacuum bag or container after use to avoid re-releasing the bugs into your garden.\n\n3. **Insecticidal Soap**: Apply a solution of insecticidal soap to the affected leaves. This can be effective but should only be used as a last resort because it can harm beneficial insects.\n\n4. **Habitat Modification**: Since boxelder bugs typically congregate on boxelder trees, removing the host plant will help reduce their numbers. In this case, since the boxelder tree has been gone for almost two years, this might not be necessary, but ensuring no other potential hosts are present nearby could be helpful.\n\n5. **Encourage Beneficial Insects**: Some beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings, feed on boxelder bugs. Encouraging these insects in your garden can help control the population naturally.\n\n6. **Cultural Practices**: Keep the garden clean and free of debris where boxelder bugs might hide. Regularly pruning and maintaining plants can also help reduce the number of hiding spots.\n\nGiven that the boxelder bug population appears to be substantial, the physical removal or vacuuming methods would likely be most effective in managing the infestation. If the population continues to grow, consider using a mild insecticidal soap as a supplementary measure. Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully before applying any pesticide.",

From a site entitled, \"Everything Lavender\" comes the following information which may help you understand why your lavender is not thriving. I hope it helps you to bring it back. It might also help you to go to Everything Lavender for even more information.\u00a0<br>Jeanne<br><br>One of the biggest problems and causes of Lavender dying out is the overwatering\u00a0of\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everything-lavender.com/growing-lavender-in-containers.html\">potted Lavender</a>\u00a0or excessive soil moisture for those plants grown in the ground. Lavender grows in loose, slightly sandy or gritty alkaline soil that is fast draining.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Over wet soil conditions leads to fungus and root rot problems.  This can cause wilted black leaves where the plant is dying back. Treatment involves cutting back of the diseased areas and allowing the plant to dry out.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Fungus can live almost anywhere. The most common fungii are Botrytis (gray mold) and Pytophthora (root rot.) They occur principally because of excess moisture either in the air or soil.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  What can you do? Clear out around the plant as much as possible such as removing dead leaves, stems or debris. Use a heat reflecting mulch of coarse builders sand, pea gravel or washed shells. Use proper spacing when planting to allow good air circulation.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Frequently, once started it is too late to save a plant suffering from this condition.\u00a0High humidity in the air can promote this type of problem as well.\u00a0What do you do?\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everything-lavender.com/lavender-care.html\">You can take cuttings from the remaining healthy sections and root them to get a new plant.</a><br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Lavender prefers loose soil that will not compact around its roots preventing the excess moisture from draining away. Place a handful of sand or small gravel in the bottom of your planting hole to allow for good drainage.\u00a0<br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Plants occasionally wilt during the heat of the day to conserve moisture if it's really hot. If you see droopy wilting Lavender do not run for water but check back in the early evening and see if the plant looks different before fetching that watering pail.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Plants can wilt from too much water meaning that the roots are waterlogged and cannot absorb what is there. If this happens your plant is a goner. The health of any plant starts with the roots. Happy roots usually mean healthy plant.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Plants do well in dry, stony poor soils which makes it an\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everything-lavender.com/planting-lavender-on-banks.html\">excellent plant to grow on a hot sunny bank</a>\u00a0where the water can easily run off.<br><br>Yellowing Leaves or Foliage<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A Lavender with yellowing leaves is a common problem. Lavender leaves turning yellow are indicative of different things depending on planting conditions. A potted or container grown plant with yellowing foliage could indicate too much or too little nitrogen.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0  Yellow leaves for those plants grown in the ground usually means a moisture problem so humidity and drainage need improvement . Yellow leaves with a gray or sooty black color is a fungal problem.Lack of Enough Light<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second biggest problem is not enough sun.\u00a0Lavender comes from a dry climate region that has tons of sun. This plant loves to sunbathe! Think about hot, sunny, breezy days at your favorite beach and you have what it likes.<br><br><br>Choosing the Wrong Location<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Frequently people plant Lavender where they want it to be and not where it prefers to be. Find a warm, sunny, airy location, and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everything-lavender.com/lavender-varieties.html\">choose the right Lavender variety</a>\u00a0for your area. Prepare the soil if necessary by loosening it and adding sand to loosen compacted clay soils and promote much needed drainage.<br><br>This is one of the keys to success. A loose friable gritty slightly alkaline soil that is fast draining will make all the difference in the world.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

                "answer": "The image shows a field of bittercress, which is a common weed that can be difficult to manage due to its invasive nature and the ease with which it can spread. The management strategy for bittercress should focus on preventing its spread and controlling its growth.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Mechanical Control**:\n   - **Hand Pulling**: While effective, it requires significant effort and is only feasible on small areas. Be sure to remove the entire taproot as it can regrow from fragments left behind.\n   - **Mulching**: Apply a thick layer of mulch over the area where bittercress is growing. This can prevent the seeds from germinating and also suffocate the existing plants if they are not too deeply rooted.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Pre-emergence Herbicides**: These are applied before the bittercress seeds germinate. They work by disrupting the growth of the seedling\u2019s roots, preventing it from emerging from the soil.\n   - **Post-emergence Herbicides**: These are used after the bittercress has emerged. They target the leaves or stems and can be more effective when the plant is actively growing. Be cautious with chemical applications to avoid harming other plants or the environment.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Mulching**: Regularly applying a layer of mulch around the plants can help suppress the growth of bittercress by reducing the amount of light reaching the soil surface.\n   - **Crop Rotation**: Avoid growing crops that are susceptible to bittercress in the same location year after year. Planting different types of crops can disrupt the life cycle of the weed.\n   - **Healthy Soil Management**: Ensure that your soil is healthy and well-nourished. A strong, robust soil ecosystem can help suppress weeds naturally.\n\n4. **Biological Control**:\n   - **Weed Eaters**: There are certain species of insects and fungi that can be introduced to control bittercress. However, these methods are less common and may not be readily available in most regions.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring and Maintenance**:\n   - Keep an eye on the area for any signs of bittercress regrowth. Regular monitoring will help you catch it early and prevent it from becoming a major problem.\n\n### Specific Considerations for Deschutes County, Oregon:\n- **Time of Year**: Bittercress tends to be most active during spring and early summer, so early intervention is crucial.\n- **Soil Type**: If",

From the pictures you sent of your one burning bush near a terraced area, the droopy leaves that curl downward is often a sign of overwatering.

All types are susceptible,\nincluding bigleaf, oakleaf, panicle, and smooth-types. The plants are not\nkilled by leaf spot, but it may reduce flowering and plant vigor. Symptoms\ninclude small circular purple spots which enlarge, and the centers of the spots\nturn tan or gray. Spores produced in the spots can be rain-splashed or\nwind-blown to other hydrangeas nearby to begin new infections. Heavily spotted\nleaves may turn yellow and drop from the plant, and fallen leaves can provide\nan overwintering place for the fungus. Management includes good air movement\nand light in plantings. Avoid overhead watering of the plants or water early in\nthe morning so that leaves can dry off during daytime. Remove the worst\naffected leaves (when they are dry) to reduce disease spread. Clean out plant\ndebris in winter to prevent overwintering of the fungus. \u00a0Fungicide treatments are recommended only on valuable\nplants with recurring damage every year.

                "response": "The leaf symptoms appear to be scorch, which is abiotic (meaning not caused by a pest or disease, at least not directly) in nature and suggests the roots might not have enough moisture. Scorch might not manifest right away, so drought stress any time in the prior weeks could be resulting in visible scorch now, even if recent rains might have been sufficient for the short term. Central Maryland has been experiencing drought for most of this year's growing season, and accumulated stress might be starting to damage some trees (and other plants) if they weren't being <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs\">monitored for watering needs</a>. Dogwoods as a group have limited drought tolerance and also prefer an exposure of mixed sun and shade; they can deal with full sun, but it's not the ideal. The proximity of a brick wall in this case might exacerbate any weather stress since it may be reflecting and/or radiating extra heat during summer as well as reducing air circulation through its canopy.\u00a0Scorch cannot reverse itself but if the roots remain healthy and watering can be monitored up until the ground freezes, the tree will likely leaf-out normally next year.<br /> <br /> Periodical cicada egg-laying damage can trigger branching in trees due to the stress on (or death of) the branch tips, but this greater degree of dense growth isn't necessarily something that needs correction. The best time to evaluate branch structure is during winter, when you can more easily observe where branches might be crossing over each other and rubbing bark, which is something to correct. That said, the best time to actually perform the pruning is <a href=\"https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/47772/VCE430_460.pdf;sequence=1\">early to midsummer for dogwoods</a>; now is too late. While pruning in late winter won't necessarily hurt the tree, it will remove lots of flowers since the tree has pre-formed next year's flower buds by now, and they will lie dormant until flowering season next year without the ability to regrow if lost to pruning or weather stress between now and then.<br /> <br /> Even though corrective pruning to remove defects that can worsen over time, like the aforementioned crossing branches, is best done when trees are young and the branches in question relatively thin,\u00a0you also want to avoid over-pruning any one year. Removing more than about a quarter of a tree's canopy in a single growing season is not advisable given the stress it can cause the plant and potential stunting affect it could have on growth, since foliage removal limits the plant's ability to generate energy and store resources for later use.<br /> <br /> There are several white-edged varieties of dogwood among American and Kousa (Asian) species, and they can look very similar to each other. Our educated guess for this tree,\u00a0based on the variety's greater availability,\u00a0the lack of obvious American Dogwood-style flower buds on the branch tips (Kousa Dogwood flower buds are more subtle), and general stature, is that this is <em>Cornus kousa</em>\u00a0'Samaritan'. A runner-up guess would be <em>Cornus kousa</em>\u00a0'Wolf Eyes', though as a more dwarf form, 'Wolf Eyes'\u00a0usually looks shrubbier at this age (lower branches and rounder overall canopy), and its foliage also tends to curl inwards more, which we don't see here. When in bloom, dogwood species are easier to tell apart, with American (<em>Cornus florida</em>) having rounded petals and opening flowers before the foliage is very far along,\u00a0and Kousa having pointed petals and opening flowers once foliage is fully expanded. Hybrids between these two, of which one or two might be variegated also, can have intermediate traits in terms of flower petal shape and when they bloom (between leaf emergence and when leaves are full size, usually).<br /> <br /> Miri",

Your friend can check for small gaps/cracks around the windows/doors where they may be entering from and seal those closed with a bit of caulk, and is also good to check for worn weathersealing around the door/window.\u00a0",

They bloom very well, but foliage is very unsightly by mid summer.  Some thrips may have been spotted, but wondering if a fungal problem is causing the browning.  Very sunny spot,  sandy soil and not great airflow around plants as they are backed by large russian sage.  Any treatment suggestion and over wintering treatment potential would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",

The immature stages are that iridescent black color, sometimes with red dots, while the adults are matte black with red-orange borders at the edges of the body. Here is a link to a photo of immature and adult bordered plant bugs so you can see them at their various stages of maturity....<br /> <a href=\"https://bugguide.net/node/view/1161477/bgimage\">https://bugguide.net/node/view/1161477/bgimage</a><br /> <br /> Bordered plant bugs feed on flowers, leaves and fruits of a variety of plants. They aren\u2019t generally considered pests, since they usually do minimal damage. However, if there are a bunch of them, they can do some noticeable damage to soft fruits (various berries, etc.). If you see bunches of these bugs and want to prevent damage to your plants, you could just gather up the individuals you find and freeze them to knock back the local population.<br /> <br /> Hope that helps!

                "response": "<p>Thanks for the question.</p> <p>Unfortunately they are not ferns. I say unfortunately because these are among the hardest invaders to eliminate. They are known as horsetails or Equisetum. They are one of the oldest living species on earth. Records exist indicating that they were here over 300 million years ago. They didn\u2019t get to exist so long by accident. They are very tough and resilient plants. Herbicides, including glyphosate (Round Up), have no effect upon them. They reproduce by the release of thousands of spores that are wind-carried to new locations. If you try to pull one up, you will discover it has a very extensive and long root systems. But in pulling it up, you will be contributing to its further distribution, since even the smallest of root pieces left in the ground will give rise to a new plant. I hope these are not growing in a location you intend for something else as they are virtually impossible to eliminate once established. I have some in my gardens and I\u2019ve just learned to live with them, talk to them, and plant around.

                "answer": "The image shows a tree that appears to have been recently pruned or has bare branches, possibly indicating it is in its dormant season or is being prepared for spring growth. There are also areas of exposed soil and mulch, which might indicate recent landscaping work.\n\nGiven the time of year (March 9, 2022), it seems like the tree is likely in its dormant phase. This is a good time for pruning as it allows the tree to heal quickly without the stress of active growth. Here are some general management strategies you can consider:\n\n1. **Pruning**: If there are dead, diseased, or crossing branches, they should be removed. Prune the tree carefully to maintain its structural integrity and shape.\n\n2. **Mulching**: Ensure that the mulch around the base of the tree is properly applied. Mulching helps retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds. However, it's important not to overmulch; a thin layer is sufficient (about 2-3 inches deep) and should be kept away from the trunk to prevent rot.\n\n3. **Watering**: Depending on the weather conditions, you might need to water the tree to ensure it gets enough moisture, especially if the area has experienced dry spells.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: In early spring, you can apply a balanced fertilizer to provide nutrients to the tree. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Management**: Inspect the tree for signs of pests or diseases. If needed, apply appropriate treatments according to the recommendations from a local horticulturist or extension office.\n\n6. **Mulch Reapplication**: If the mulch has been disturbed, reapply it to maintain the benefits mentioned above.\n\n7. **Mulch Ring**: Create a small ring of mulch around the tree trunk to help retain moisture and reduce weed competition. This ring should be wide but shallow, typically about 2-3 feet in diameter and 2-3 inches deep.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure the health and vitality of the tree. If you notice any unusual symptoms or concerns, consulting with a local arborist or horticulturist would be advisable.",

To address this issue, the following steps can be recommended:\n\n1. **Identify the Cause**: Determine the exact cause of the leaf discoloration. This can often be done by examining the affected leaves closely under magnification or consulting with an agricultural extension agent who can provide a more precise diagnosis.\n\n2. **Prune Affected Areas**: If the discoloration is localized, it may be beneficial to prune out the affected areas to prevent the spread of the issue. Ensure that you are using clean tools to avoid further contamination.\n\n3. **Water Management**: Check the watering schedule. Overwatering or underwatering can both lead to leaf issues. Ensure the soil is well-drained and that the rhododendron receives consistent moisture but not excess water.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Assess if the plant might be lacking essential nutrients. Fertilize according to the soil test results. Use a balanced fertilizer suitable for acid-loving plants like rhododendrons.\n\n5. **Cultural Care**: Ensure the plant is receiving adequate light, temperature, and humidity levels. Rhododendrons prefer partially shaded conditions and thrive in moist, acidic soil.\n\n6. **Insecticides and Fungicides**: If the issue is identified as a fungal or bacterial infection, consider applying appropriate fungicides or bactericides. Follow the instructions carefully as these treatments need to be used correctly to be effective.\n\n7. **Monitor Regularly**: Continue to monitor the plant for any signs of improvement or new symptoms. If the problem persists or worsens, seek advice from a local nursery or garden center specialist.\n\nBy following these steps, the health of the rhododendron can be improved, and the leaf discoloration should subside.",

However, the most common cause of leaf spot is caused by four common fungi. These fungi may cause leaf spot on other ornamental trees also. When environmental conditions are moist and the spores of these fungi are present, they can germinate on the wet leaves of many different plants. Therefore, the disease is likely to occur during rainy or humid weather.</p> <p>Leaf spot is not considered a threat to a healthy tree. But it can be serious to trees under stress, such as young trees. It can be controlled by cultural practices. Because the fungus survives in compost and soil, it is best to rake up and dispose of any leaves or branches that have fallen to prevent any future infection. Increase air circulation around the tree by pruning out broken and rubbing branches and branches of neighboring trees that may encroach on the tree\u2019s space. At the end of the growing season, prune out any infected stems and leaves and clean up and dispose of the infected material.

MSU Extension\u2019s Plant and Pest Diagnostic Lab can identify the fungus. Go to: <a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/</a> to learn how to submit a sample.</p> <p>Because fungicides are a preventative, not a cure, it is necessary to spray the plant before the fungus attacks the leaves. When using chemicals, read the label to ensure that it can be used against that disease on that specific plant. Follow the label directions on how to use the chemical.</p> <p>A certified arborist can assess the tree.

The coneflowers are characterized by their distinctive dark brown central cone surrounded by vibrant purple petals. The image also shows green foliage, including the serrated leaves of the plant, which are typical for coneflowers.\n\nIn the background, there is a hint of other greenery, suggesting that these flowers are part of a larger garden or natural setting. The lighting appears to be natural daylight, possibly taken during the morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the softness and angle of light. There is no visible insect or animal activity in the image, but the presence of such pollinators is common on coneflowers.\n\nThe timestamp suggests that the photo was taken in Jefferson County, Colorado, on August 1, 2023, at 2:54 AM. This early hour might explain the softer light conditions, which could be due to either dawn or dusk depending on the season.",

They were neglected this year as the temps dropped I forgot them outside and they went through 25 degrees one night. One showed classic frost damage, wilted and dropped green leaves and the second one was barely damaged. Only the newest growth was killed. A few months later the mostly unfrosted one had several leaves that started to change color and dry up randomly across the crown. It appears to be some kind of disease. There is a distinct margin between healthy leaf and desiccated leaf. The discoloration starts at the tip of a leaf and progresses slowly up the leaves. It is only on older leaves. One healthy branch was cut off and placed in a glass of water and the same symptoms started a week later. I'm pretty good with tree diseases but can't find anything like this in citrus in my research. It looks very much like oak wilt but in a citrus tree.</p>",

I understand there importance to nature but unfortunately it completely interrupts our nights if we want to have people over or hang out around the fire. \r\n\r\nDoes grubex work?  I'm not sure who to reach out, I've talked to pest control they don't even know what a stag beetle is.  \r\n\r\nIf someone could please help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJoe Waldoch\r\n(952)356-7195",

Winter sunlight is intense\u00a0a mile high and when the sun is low in the sky and there is no canopy of leaves to cast shade on the trunk, tree cells get warmed up and become active but then burst when the\u00a0temperature drop at sundown. It is a common but concerning problem.</p><p>My recommendation is clean the wound by cutting off any stray flaps of bark where insect pest could hide behind\u00a0and try to\u00a0create clean margins. Then wrap the trunk with tree wrap from Thanksgiving through Tax Day. If the wound has not completely girdled the trunk, the tree with time has the capability of healing itself with wound wood.</p><p>I also recommend pulling away any grass or mulch that might be resting up against the trunk which\u00a0can result in nicks and cuts from lawn mowers and string trimmers. If mulch rests up against the trunk it can create too much dampness against the bark and lead to rot. Just pull it back a few inches: mulch is\u00a0good for retaining moisture in\u00a0the soil and roots but not good for the bark.</p><p>Here is some additional information:</p><p><a href=\"https://source.colostate.edu/prepare-trees-winter/\">https://source.colostate.edu/prepare-trees-winter/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/environmental-disorders-of-woody-plants-2-932/\">https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/environmental-disorders-of-woody-plants-2-932/</a></p>",

This suggests the branch has been exposed to the elements for some time and is in a state of decay.\n\n3. **Green Grass**: In contrast to the dried leaves, there are patches of green grass visible, indicating that some areas of the ground remain lush and alive.\n\n4. **Wooden Fence**: To the left side of the image, part of a wooden fence is visible, constructed from vertical wooden planks. The wood appears weathered but intact, adding a rustic element to the scene.\n\n5. **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening, as indicated by the warm, golden light. Shadows cast by the fence and other objects add depth and dimension to the image.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a peaceful autumn setting, with natural elements like decaying vegetation and fallen leaves blending with man-made structures like the wooden fence.",

                "response": "Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) is generally grown in our area as a small plant or tree in a container.. While it is a Mediterranean native, it is not hardy below 20 degrees. Many winters we do not reach temperatures that low, but certain areas of the county do experience lower temperatures on occasion. Obviously, a container plant can more easily be protected or brought inside when the threat of cold is present. Bay laurels thrive on moderate water. Your drip system may be giving the plant too much water and that is the reason for the brown tips on most leaves. But the major problem is the insect infestation on the stems and some of the leaves. Thank you for the photo, but it is not detailed enough to identify the white critters on the stems as whitefly or scale, both of which can sap the energy of the plant, eventually killing it.Scale is one of the most common enemies of bay laurel.. A horticultural oil spray or two will take care of the critters and not compromise the edibility of the leaves. It was not clear whether the leaves were dusty or affected by powdery mildew. You might want to hose off the plant to remove the \"dust\" and if it doesn't clean up, you probably need to\u00a0 check it for\u00a0 mildew.\u00a0 Powdery mildew is common in the semi- humid temperatures such as our typical spring\u00a0 weather, It can be treated with neem oil, horticultural oil, or copper soap fungicide. Given all these indications of the\u00a0 bad health of the plant, you might be better off replacing the plant with a container specimen... \u00a0 <br><br><br>",

                "answer": "The image shows a bay laurel plant with some leaves that appear to be browning or dying. This could indicate several issues, such as overwatering, nutrient deficiencies, or pest infestation. Given the location and care history of the plant:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Since the plant is receiving regular drip irrigation, it's possible that there may be overwatering issues. Overwatering can lead to root rot and nutrient deficiencies as the soil becomes too saturated. Ensure the soil is well-draining; if it\u2019s not, consider amending the soil with organic matter like compost to improve drainage.\n\n2. **Nutrient Deficiency**: Despite adding compost, there might still be a lack of certain nutrients. Check for signs of nutrient deficiency such as yellowing of older leaves (which might indicate iron deficiency) or chlorosis. You can test the soil for nutrient levels using a soil test kit.\n\n3. **Pest Infestation**: The presence of pests can also cause leaf damage. Common pests that affect bay laurels include spider mites, aphids, and scale insects. Look closely at the leaves and stems for signs of pests and their eggs. If pests are present, you may need to use an appropriate insecticide.\n\n4. **Disease**: Diseases such as fungal leaf spot or blight can cause leaf discoloration. Inspect the leaves for signs of spots, mold, or other unusual growths. Treatments for these diseases often involve fungicides, but first ensure proper identification.\n\n**Management Strategy:**\n\n1. **Adjust Watering Schedule**: Reduce the frequency and duration of irrigation to prevent overwatering. Monitor the soil moisture levels regularly to ensure they are neither too dry nor waterlogged.\n\n2. **Soil Test and Fertilization**: Test the soil to check for nutrient deficiencies. Based on the results, apply appropriate fertilizers to replenish any missing nutrients. Consider using a balanced fertilizer formulated for evergreen plants.\n\n3. **Monitor for Pests**: Regularly inspect the plant for signs of pests. If pests are identified, treat them promptly. Use organic pesticides or insecticidal soaps if necessary.\n\n4. **Fungal Treatment**: If disease is suspected, apply a fungicide specifically designed for use on bay laurels. Follow the instructions carefully.\n\n5. **Mulch**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain moisture and suppress weeds, which can compete for nutrients.\n\n6. **Pruning**: Remove any dead or diseased branches to promote healthy",

The easiest thing to try is to trim off the dead leaves, put the plant in a sunny window, and do not water again until the potting mix is almost dry. Then only water lightly again whenever the potting mix is almost dry. The second and better option is to repot the plant into a cactus or succulent houseplant potting mix and treat as described in option one.

Oak trees tend to have that problem as the soil ties up the nutrients of magnesium and iron. Do the leave have a green vein? The bark pictures seem to be ok. You say one side of the tree did not recover. Another killer of oak trees is oak wilt. There is little chance of recovery if that is the problem. This can be caused by pruning when the tree is not dormant. <br /> I have had a pin oak where i had chlorosis and i tried treating the tree. It did not work. The tree will grow but will lose branches and has a slow death. May i suggest you contact your local ohio state extension office. Before i sign of let me know if your leaves have the green vein and yellow leaves. Thanks.\u00a0",

The presence of these elements suggests the plant might be growing in a garden or a farm setting.\n\n4. **Lighting**: The lighting appears to be natural sunlight, with shadows cast by the leaves.

                "answer": "The image shows leaves with white spots, which could indicate a fungal infection or disease. Given that this tree was planted in February and the issue developed over the last month, it's important to identify the specific cause of the symptoms before applying a management strategy.\n\nHere\u2019s a general approach to managing the issue:\n\n### Identification and Diagnosis\n1. **Visual Inspection**: Look closely at the leaves for any signs of disease, such as the type of spots (size, shape, color), presence of mold or fungus, and if there are any visible symptoms on the undersides of the leaves.\n2. **Fungal Spores**: If present, collect samples and bring them to a local extension office or plant diagnostic lab for confirmation of the type of fungus involved.\n3. **Environmental Factors**: Consider the environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and irrigation practices, which can affect fungal growth.\n\n### Management Strategies\nIf the diagnosis confirms a fungal infection, here are some potential management strategies:\n\n1. **Fungicide Application**: Use a fungicide specifically targeted against the identified fungal species. Follow the label instructions carefully for application rates and frequency.\n2. **Pruning**: Remove any severely affected leaves or branches to reduce the spread of the fungus and to improve air circulation around the remaining foliage.\n3. **Water Management**: Ensure proper irrigation practices to avoid overwatering or underwatering, which can stress the tree and make it more susceptible to disease.\n4. **Fertilization**: Apply a balanced fertilizer to promote overall tree health, but be cautious not to over-fertilize, as excessive nutrients can also stress the tree.\n5. **Cultural Practices**: Maintain good cultural practices such as mulching, pruning for air circulation, and monitoring the tree regularly for early detection of new symptoms.\n\n### Monitoring\nRegularly monitor the tree for any signs of recovery or new infections. If the infection persists or worsens, consider consulting a professional arborist who can provide more specific advice based on the tree's condition and the identified pathogen.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage the disease and potentially prevent further damage to the Monterey oak tree.",

                "response": "Yes, these are a <a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/european-hornets\">European Hornets</a>, a non-native wasp that has been in the U.S. for over a century and which is commonly encountered in late summer because colonies have become almost as large as they're going to get for the year. Workers hunt for other insects to bring back to the nest, so they can frequent flowering plants and will also visit porch lights at night to pluck off prey like moths attracted to the light. This is one of the only wasps that flies at night as well as during the day, so if you use outdoor lighting, consider turning it off if it's attracting too many of these hornets. Like many bees and wasps, they might accidentally bump into window glass due to the reflection, or bump into window screens, maybe if they miss catching another flying insect they were pursuing.<br /> <br /> Despite their intimidating size, these hornets tend not to bother people unless they feel threatened, like someone approaching a nest too closely (especially if there are loud vibrations, such as thumping a tree they're nesting in or using a lawn mower near a nest) or trying to swat or catch an adult out foraging. These wasps might be drawn to certain plants if sap-sucking insects are feeding heavily (they consume droplets of sugar-water produced by those insects) or if they find the bark appealing, since they will chew off a bit of it to use to make the paper-like lining of their nest. Fortunately, the bark-chewing damage on branches of lilac or other shrubs is not serious.<br /> <br /> Nests are not re-used from year to year, so once we enter late autumn and winter, frosty nights will end nest activity and kill any workers left.<br /> <br /> Miri ",

Velvetleaf is known for its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.\n\n### Management Strategies for Velvetleaf:\n\n1. **Manual Removal**:\n   - **Early Detection**: Manual removal of velvetleaf seedlings and small plants is most effective when they are still young and have not yet set seeds. Use gloves to protect your hands from the sticky sap.\n   - **Digging**: Carefully dig up the plant roots and dispose of them properly, ensuring you remove all parts of the plant, including any underground stems or rhizomes.\n   - **Frequent Monitoring**: Since velvetleaf can re-sprout from fragments left behind, regular monitoring and follow-up digging may be necessary.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Herbicides**: Apply selective herbicides like glyphosate (Roundup) or systemic herbicides such as triclopyr (e.g., Garlon) directly to the leaves or stems of the plant. Follow the instructions on the label carefully, as these chemicals can harm other plants if not used correctly.\n   - **Preventive Measures**: Treat the soil around the plants with non-selective herbicides to prevent new plants from sprouting. This method should be used cautiously and only after removing visible plants.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Mulching**: Regularly mulching the area where the plant was found can help prevent the spread of seeds. Mulch can also suppress the germination of new seeds by blocking light.\n   - **Healthy Native Plants**: Encourage the growth of healthy, native plants that can compete with the invasive velvetleaf for resources. Native plants often have deeper root systems that can outcompete the invasive species.\n\n4. **Biological Control**:\n   - **Natural Enemies**: Research and consider introducing natural enemies of velvetleaf into your garden. For example, certain insects can feed on the plant and reduce its population.\n\n5. **Community Efforts**:\n   - **Neighborhood Cooperation**: If the velvetleaf spreads to neighboring yards, consider organizing a community effort to manage the problem collectively.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Environmental Impact**: Be cautious with chemical treatments as they can affect beneficial organisms and local ecosystems.\n- **Legal Compliance**: Check local regulations regarding the use of herbicides and the management of invasive species in your area.\n- **Sustainability**: Opt",

                "answer": "The image shows a lawn with Poa triv (roughstalk bluegrass) dominating the landscape, as indicated by the background information. The grass appears to be in large patches and some isolated spots, and it is described as being dormant at the time of the photo.\n\nGiven these observations, here's a recommended management strategy:\n\n### Immediate Actions:\n1. **Evaluate Dormancy**: Since the grass is described as dormant, the immediate priority should be to determine whether there are underlying issues causing dormancy. This could include soil compaction, improper watering, or nutrient deficiencies. If the dormancy is due to environmental factors such as drought, the lawn might recover once conditions improve.\n\n2. **Watering Management**: Assess the current watering schedule. If the lawn is dry, consider increasing the frequency and duration of watering sessions until the grass becomes more active. However, be cautious not to overwater, which can lead to root rot and other issues.\n\n3. **Soil Analysis**: Conduct a soil test to check the pH level, nutrient content, and overall health of the soil. This will help identify if there are any deficiencies that need addressing, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, or other essential nutrients.\n\n### Long-term Strategies:\n1. **Fertilization**: Once the soil analysis is complete, apply appropriate fertilizers to address any deficiencies identified. Choose a fertilizer that is balanced and suitable for cool-season grasses like Poa triv.\n\n2. **Aeration**: If the lawn is compacted, aerating the soil can help improve air and water penetration into the roots, promoting healthier growth.\n\n3. **Dethatching**: Remove thatch buildup from the lawn, as thick thatch layers can restrict air and water movement and hinder nutrient absorption. This step is crucial for maintaining healthy grass growth.\n\n4. **Seeding Mix**: Consider overseeding with a mix that includes varieties of turfgrass better adapted to the local climate and conditions. This can help reduce the dominance of Poa triv and potentially improve overall lawn quality.\n\n5. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around established plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil structure.\n\nBy addressing the immediate needs and implementing long-term strategies, you can help promote the recovery and improvement of your lawn, making it more resilient and aesthetically pleasing.",

If you have seen small moth like bugs flying out of your grass as you mow it increases the probability that chinch bugs are the problem.\n\nThe above link will provide some direction to diagnosing and treating the problem.  Many of these problems can be overcome with overseeing and fertilizing in the fall to establish a better turf base along with preventive measures that are most effective when performed (usually in the Spring or early summer) before the damage is apparent. \n\n",

You can spray the stump next year to prevent further infestation. Spraying is best when done in the flying stage, which is May - June. You can create a trap to help with timing; when you see beetles in the trap, it's time to spray.

There are patches where the bark has peeled away or is worn down, revealing lighter-colored wood underneath.\n\n2. **White Fungus-like Growth**: On the tree trunk, there is a significant white growth that resembles a fungus. It is irregularly shaped and protrudes from the surface of the bark. This growth could be a type of bracket fungus (e.g., Polyporus or Laetiporus species) which is often found on the sides of trees and can be indicative of wood decay caused by fungal infection.\n\n3. **Yellowish-Green Lichen**: There are small patches of yellowish-green lichen scattered across the bark and around the white growth. Lichens are symbiotic organisms made up of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. They are common on tree bark and can vary in color.\n\n4. **Fallen Leaves**: The ground below the tree trunk is covered with fallen leaves, suggesting it might be autumn. The leaves appear to be a mix of green and yellow hues, indicating seasonal change.\n\n5. **Branches**: A few branches are visible near the trunk, some of which appear dry and brittle, possibly fallen off during a storm or due to natural aging.\n\n6. **Soil and Vegetation**: In the background, there is soil and more vegetation, including grass and other plants, indicating an outdoor setting. \n\nThe overall scene suggests a forested area in North Dakota, with a focus on a section of a large tree showing signs of fungal growth and the effects of time and environmental conditions.",

                "answer": "The image shows a patch of grass with a noticeable discoloration and dryness, which appears to be concentrated around the edges of what might be a flower bed or garden bed that was covered with straw over winter. Given that the straw was used to protect tulip beds, it's likely that the straw is still present under the grass. Here\u2019s a recommended management strategy:\n\n1. **Remove Straw**: Carefully remove the straw from the area where it is causing the discoloration. Ensure that you do not damage the grass roots while lifting the straw. This can be done using a rake or similar tool.\n\n2. **Watering**: Once the straw is removed, water the affected areas thoroughly to encourage new growth. Watering deeply but less frequently will help establish healthy roots in the grass.\n\n3. **Aeration**: If the grass looks thin or weak, consider aerating the soil. This can be done using a lawn aerator to improve soil structure and promote better root development.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Apply a balanced fertilizer after the lawn has recovered from the stress of removing the straw and watering. This will provide nutrients essential for the grass to grow strong and healthy.\n\n5. **Mowing**: Once the grass has recovered, mow the area at the appropriate height for your type of grass. Keeping the grass at a proper length can help it recover faster and reduce the risk of diseases.\n\n6. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on the grass for signs of further stress or disease. If the condition persists, consult with a local landscaper or horticulturist for additional advice.\n\nThis approach should help address the issue of the grass looking unhealthy due to the straw cover. It is important to handle the straw carefully to avoid damaging the grass and to ensure that the grass has ample time to recover before any additional treatments are applied.",

Some scale (there a many types) have a softer cover which lets beneficial insects that hunt scale to get at them and also allows insecticidal sprays to be effective.\u00a0 Prunicola scale has an extra cover making it more difficult to manage. Be aware it can take a year or so to get control.\u00a0\u00a0 The best timing of insecticides is when the eggs beneath the female scales hatch into \"crawlers\" which lack the defenses of the adult.\u00a0</p> <p>Woody plants under stress--like drought--may be more susceptible to infestation so you will want to help build up the plant defenses by keeping it hydrated.</p> <p>In bad infestations, horticultural oil sprays applied with\u00a0thorough coverage while the crawlers are active is recommended and will need to be repeated with each period of crawler emergence from now into September. It may also require a systemic/oil combination applied according to directions with an eye to temperature</p> <p>Here is our much\u00a0more detailed resource material on this particular pest:</p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/white-prunicola-scale\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/white-prunicola-scale</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pesticide-profile-horticultural-oil\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pesticide-profile-horticultural-oil</a></p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

                "response": "I can agree with your diagnosis. You are right that there a lot of fungal and bacterial problems on blueberry. But your image does not really show any of them specifically. I see a light brown necrosis mainly between major leaf veins. That can be typical when the roots are unable to keep up with the water demand of the leaves. The stems look fine so it should do well next year. <br /> We do need to be careful about overwatering. Root rot can give you very similar symptoms. Blueberries have a shallow root system and will need less water more often. A lot of water less often is not a good combination. Good luck with your garden.\u00a0",

Here's a recommended management strategy for dealing with such issues:\n\n### Diagnosis and Confirmation:\n1. **Identify the Disease**: Confirm the exact type of disease (e.g., leaf blight) by consulting local agricultural extension services or a plant pathologist. This will guide the appropriate treatments.\n\n### Management Strategies:\n2. **Pruning and Removal**:\n   - Remove and destroy infected leaves and branches to prevent the spread of the disease. This helps reduce the inoculum in the environment.\n   \n3. **Fungicide Application**:\n   - Apply fungicides as per the recommendations from the diagnostic confirmation. Common fungicides used for blueberry diseases include copper-based sprays, sulfur, and specific fungicides like mancozeb or thiophanate-methyl. Follow the label instructions carefully for application timing and frequency.\n   \n4. **Water Management**:\n   - Ensure proper irrigation practices to avoid waterlogging, which can contribute to fungal growth. Avoid overhead watering and ensure good drainage around the plants.\n   \n5. **Crop Rotation**:\n   - Rotate crops to prevent buildup of pathogens in the soil. Avoid planting blueberries in the same location every year if possible.\n   \n6. **Soil Health**:\n   - Maintain healthy soil through mulching, composting, and regular soil testing to ensure proper nutrient levels and pH balance.\n   \n7. **Monitoring**:\n   - Regularly monitor the plants for signs of new infections and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.\n\n8. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - Practice good sanitation and cultural practices such as maintaining adequate air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity and promote healthier growth.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help manage the disease effectively and maintain the health of your blueberry plants.

                "response": "<p>Hello,<br /> <br /> Those are wasps known as Cicada Killers.The larger is a female, the smaller one is a male.<br /></p> <p>These spectacular insects are known scientifically as Sphecius speciosus (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae). They are the largest wasp that occurs in Michigan. They occur in all states east of the Rocky Mountains and prefer to dig their burrows in sandy, bare, well-drained soil exposed to full sunlight. The wasps feed on flower nectar while the immature or larval stages feed cicadas that are provide to them by the female wasp. Like other solitary wasps with no large colony to defend, cicada killers usually ignore people as they go about their business of digging holes and hunting for cicadas. A mound of fine soil surrounds the burrow of each female cicada killer. Since colonies of burrows are common, infested lawns usually contain several mounds that can smother the grass. However, they prefer to nest in areas of sparse vegetation, and rarely infest thick, vigorous turf. <br /> <br /> Cicada killers overwinter as larvae in the soil. Pupation occurs in the spring and the adults emerge in mid-June to early July. Emergence continues throughout the summer. Females feed, mate, and dig burrows for several weeks before hunting for cicadas in nearby trees. Excess soil thrown out of the burrow forms a regular, U-shaped mound at the entrance. <br /> <br /> The females search tree trunks and lower limbs for cicadas. The wasp stings its prey, turns the victim on its back, straddles it, and drags it or glides with it to the burrow. Each burrow includes several cells where larvae are raised. Each cell is furnished with at least one cicada (sometimes two or three) and a single egg before being sealed off. Female eggs are provisioned with 2 or 3 cicadas while males are only get one. As a result male cicada killers are much smaller than the females. Males establish territories near nesting females and aggressively defend their territory from other intruding males. The eggs hatch in 2-3 days. Depending on the number of cicadas in its cell, the larva feeds for 4 to 10 days until only the cicada's outer shell remains. During the fall, the larva spins a silken case, shrinks, and prepares to overwinter. Only one generation occurs each year. <br /> <br /> Despite their large size and impressive stinger, cicada killers do not readily sting and one can stand amongst their burrows and watch them work without fear of being stung as long as one remains considerate and respectful, i.e., don\u2019t try and catch one with their hands. Most people I talk to however seem reluctant to get that close and would rather kill them off. Cultural practices can prevent or eliminate the establishment of cicada killer colonies. Adequate lime and fertilizer applications accompanied by frequent watering to promote a thick growth of turf and can usually eliminate a cicada killer infestation in one or two seasons. For those not willing to tolerate the wasps, treating the nest openings with Sevin (spray or dust) will eliminate the wasps. Be sure to read and follow all instructions and safety precautions found on the label before using any pesticide. <br /> <br /> Read more than you will ever care to know about cicada killers at:<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20141022032916/http:/sites.lafayette.edu/hollidac/research/biology-of-cicada-killer-wasps/\">http://web.archive.org/web/20141022032916/http://sites.lafayette.edu/hollidac/research/biology-of-cicada-killer-wasps/</a></p> <p><br /> Regards,<br /> Howard</p> <p>Tell us about your experience with our service by completing the brief (5 min.), anonymous <a href=\"https://msu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2o9fyUvBjSeAPNs\" target=\"_blank\">MSU Plant &amp; Pest Diagnostics Feedback Survey</a>. </p>",

                "answer": "The image shows a wasp trapped inside a glass, which appears to have been caught while it was drinking water. Wasps can sometimes be attracted to water sources due to their thirst or to drink water containing nectar from flowers. Here are some general recommendations for managing such an issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Species**: While the image depicts a wasp, ensure that you are correctly identifying the species. Wasps are generally beneficial insects as they help control pest populations, but certain species like hornets and yellow jackets can be aggressive.\n\n2. **Containment**: If the wasp is still alive, place it in a container with a lid and release it outdoors where it will not pose a threat. Ensure the container is large enough for the insect to move around comfortably.\n\n3. **Prevent Recurrence**: If the wasp was attracted to water, consider removing any standing water in the area, as this can attract other insects. Regularly check and empty bird baths, pet dishes, and other water containers.\n\n4. **Safe Removal**: If the wasp is dead, dispose of it properly. Avoid handling it directly as it may have stingers that could harm you.\n\n5. **Environmental Management**: Maintain a clean and tidy environment around your home to reduce the attractiveness of your property to insects. Remove food scraps and pet waste promptly, and keep outdoor areas free of clutter.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: If the issue persists, especially if it involves multiple wasps or aggressive species, consider contacting a professional exterminator for assistance.\n\nRemember, the primary goal is to safely remove the insect without causing harm to yourself or others.",

Just keep it watered,\u00a0especially during dry, hot weather.<br /> <br /> Protect all young trees from wildlife damage by excluding them from the plant. Use hardware\u00a0cloth in a circle around the tree wide enough to encircle the branches and firmly staked down;\u00a0and while young completely cage it by using chicken wire or hardware cloth across the top of the cage. Or install a deer fence as outlined in the guides below.<br /> <br /> Rabbits and voles can also damage trees over winter, so wire mesh \u00a0too small for them to squeeze through can be used as a trunk guard,\u00a0and perforated\u00a0trunk guards help, too.<br /> Here are some examples-<br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/white-tailed-deer-damage#fencing-1880561\">https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/white-tailed-deer-damage#fencing-1880561</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/protecting-trees-and-shrubs-winter#deer-972413\">https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/protecting-trees-and-shrubs-winter#deer-972413</a><br /> <br /> Here is a guide to growing fruit trees, including fertilizer timing. \u00a0<a href=\"https://plantpathology.ca.uky.edu/files/mw_home_fruit_productn_b591.pdf\">https://plantpathology.ca.uky.edu/files/mw_home_fruit_productn_b591.pdf</a>",

The presence of multiple leafy stems and the way they are growing close together suggests it might be forming a dense, ground-hugging mat that could be undesirable if it's not wanted on your property.\n\nHere are some management strategies for controlling Virginia creeper:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: Dig up the plants manually. Be sure to remove all the roots, as even small pieces can regrow into new plants. This method is labor-intensive but effective for smaller infestations.\n\n2. **Herbicides**: Use selective herbicides designed for broadleaf weeds like Virginia creeper. Apply the herbicide to the foliage when the plant is actively growing. Always follow the label instructions carefully, as some herbicides may harm desirable plants or be harmful to pets and children.\n\n3. **Biological Control**: In some cases, biological controls such as specific insects or fungi can be used to manage Virginia creeper, though these methods are less common and may not be available everywhere.\n\n4. **Preventative Measures**: If you don't want Virginia creeper to spread further, you can cover the soil with a thick layer of mulch or landscape fabric to prevent the runners from reaching the surface and growing new vines.\n\n5. **Cultural Practices**: Regularly mow grass and keep the area free of debris to reduce the likelihood of Virginia creeper taking hold. This practice can help suppress its growth by reducing competition for sunlight and nutrients.\n\nChoose the strategy that best fits your needs and the conditions on your property. It's important to address the issue promptly to prevent the Virginia creeper from spreading and becoming a more difficult problem to control.",

However, larvae will also attack eggplant, pepper, and potato. There are many solonaceous weeds\u00a0that will host this pest. The one in your photo\u00a0is covered with cocoons of pupating braconid wasps, which are beneficial insects.\u00a0Larvae that hatch from wasp eggs laid on the hornworm feed on the inside of the hornworm until the wasp is ready to pupate. The hornworm should be left in the garden to conserve the beneficial parasitoids. The wasps will kill the hornworms when they emerge from the cocoons and will seek out other hornworms to parasitize.

This plant appears to be a type of juniper, which is an evergreen shrub or small tree known for its needle-like leaves and often found in various climates, including those in Michigan.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Identify the Specific Species**: Confirm the exact species of the juniper by comparing it with local guides or consulting with a local horticulturist or botanist. Junipers can have variations in appearance based on their specific variety.\n\n2. **Assess the Health of the Plant**: Look for any signs of disease or pest infestation that could be causing the plant to look stressed or unhealthy. Common issues include juniper blight, scale insects, or mites.\n\n3. **Maintenance Practices**:\n   - **Pruning**: Regularly prune the juniper to maintain its shape and prevent overcrowding. This helps in improving air circulation and reducing the risk of diseases.\n   - **Watering**: Ensure that the plant receives adequate water, but avoid overwatering as junipers are drought-tolerant. Water deeply but less frequently.\n   - **Fertilization**: Use a slow-release fertilizer appropriate for conifers during the growing season (spring and early summer).\n\n4. **Control Pests and Diseases**:\n   - **Inspect the Plant**: Carefully inspect the plant for any signs of pests or disease, such as discoloration of needles, presence of galls, or unusual growth patterns.\n   - **Treatment**: If pests or diseases are identified, treat them promptly. Common treatments include horticultural oils, insecticidal soaps, or fungicides as recommended by a professional or botanical expert.\n\n5. **Environmental Adaptation**: Junipers are generally hardy plants, but ensure they are planted in conditions that match their natural habitat. Junipers prefer well-drained soil and full sun. Check if the location in Oakland County, Michigan, supports these requirements.\n\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the health of the juniper to catch any issues early and manage them effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure the juniper remains healthy and vibrant in your Oakland County, Michigan, environment.",

Under such conditions lilac roots are unable\nto supply sufficient water to the foliage to replace what is lost by\ntranspiration from the leaves.\u00a0 Lilacs\nneed a steady supply of water to maintain themselves.\u00a0 If they do not have this available to them,\nbrowning of leaves will occur.\u00a0 In most\ncases unless the lilacs are unhealthy to begin with, there is no cause for\nserious concern.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>See the following for further information and possible remedial\nactions:</p>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-and-plant-advice/horticulture-care/leaf-scorch\">https://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-and-plant-advice/horticulture-care/leaf-scorch</a></p>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/gardening/2012/07/scorched_lilac_tree.html\">https://www.pennlive.com/gardening/2012/07/scorched_lilac_tree.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If it is leaf scorch, the branches on which these brown\nleaves are found should NOT be\ndead.\u00a0 There\u2019s an easy way to determine\nthis.\u00a0 With your finger nail or a sharp\nknife, scrape a small amount of bark away from the branch.\u00a0 If the underlying tissue is green and not\nbrown, the branch is alive and should survive.\u00a0\nIf the branch is dead, just cut it out about six inches above the\nsoil.\u00a0 If by chance you find a majority\nof the lilac branches are dead, then we are not dealing with leaf scorch and\nsomething else.\u00a0 If this is the case,\nplease get back to us and we\u2019ll investigate things further.</p>\n\n<p>Good Luck!!</p>",

Given the location and time of year (August), it's possible that the lilacs are experiencing summer wilt, which is common during hot and dry periods.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Watering**: Ensure the soil around the lilac bushes is kept moist, especially if there has been little rainfall. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Remove any dead or dying branches and leaves. This will help reduce the spread of disease and improve air circulation, which can slow down the progression of any disease.\n\n3. **Fertilizing**: Apply a balanced fertilizer in late spring or early summer to support healthy growth. Avoid fertilizing after mid-August as it can encourage late-season growth which may be susceptible to frost damage.\n\n4. **Pest Control**: Inspect the lilacs for signs of pests such as aphids, scale, or mites. If present, treat them promptly with an appropriate insecticide. Neem oil or insecticidal soap are effective organic options.\n\n5. **Disease Management**: Look for signs of fungal diseases like powdery mildew or rust. If you suspect a fungal infection, apply a fungicide specifically formulated for lilacs. Copper-based fungicides are commonly used and effective.\n\n6. **Monitor Health**: Continue to monitor the health of the lilacs. Regular inspections can help catch issues early and prevent them from worsening.\n\n7. **Soil Improvement**: Consider improving the soil structure by adding organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure. This can enhance nutrient retention and improve drainage.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to manage the symptoms observed and promote the health of your lilac bushes. If the issue persists, consulting with a local horticulturist or plant specialist could provide more specific advice tailored to your conditions.",

        "question": "Hello, In November 2020 we had two 2&quot; crabapples planted in our meadow. the SnowDrift crabapple has recently developed a growth (fungus?) on the bark, lost leaves on some branches, and has spots on the remaining leaves. Attaching pictures of that (i have more of leaves if that would help). The Robinson crabapple looks much better but I do see some spots on leaves and some of the problem on the branches (i have pics I can send). Is this apple scab or something else? What is recommended response (we have largely native meadow and pollinator-friendly acres just fyi). Thanks so much for your advice!",

(Don't compost.)</p> <p>There are apple trees varieties that are resistant to the cedar apple rust.\u00a0\u00a0 I have attached links to fact sheets from\u00a0University Extension web sites listing those varieties.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0An approved fungicide for this use may be sprayed on the apple tree, however, this should be started in early spring.\u00a0 \u00a0The attached link to a Purdue fact sheet lists chemical controls that may be used effective.\u00a0 Not all fungicides will control this fungus.\u00a0 If using chemical controls always read and follow directions.\u00a0 \u00a0</p> <p>The option of removing one of the two host trees, or not planting cedars and apples within sight of each other, is another option.\u00a0 Of course, this option may not be feasible in a neighborhood situation.<br /><br />I also have attached links to University Extension fact sheets showing clear photos of the various stages of cedar apple rust on both the cedar and apple trees, which may help you identify the galls when they appear on the cedars.\u00a0\u00a0<br /></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/bp/bp-138-w.pdf\">Cedar Apple and Related Rusts on Apples in the Home Landscape (purdue.edu)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/cedar-apple-rust#managing-rust-on-apples%2C-hawthorns%2C-and-other-plants-in-the-rosaceae-family-1172760\">Cedar-apple rust and related rust diseases | UMN Extension</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/cedar-apple-and-related-rusts-on-ornamentals\">Cedar Apple And Related Rusts on Ornamentals (psu.edu)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://lancaster.unl.edu/hort/articles/2002/cedarapplerust.shtml\">Cedar-Apple Rust (cedarapplerust) | Nebraska Extension in Lancaster County (unl.edu)</a></p> <p>I hope you find this information helpful!\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

Many pesticides carry a cautionary note about their use in, or impacts on, aquatic habitats. At around a thousand feet of distance, however, this is unlikely to be close enough for measurable contamination from homeowner use.</p><p>The symptoms in your photo are caused by rust (most likely\u00a0cedar-quince rust). It's a very common fungus that has to switch between two unrelated plants to complete its life cycle. When you see spores on this host (pear and their relatives in the rose family), the rust is only trying to re-infect junipers and cannot infect other rose-family plants. No use of fungicide at this point will have any effect, so we do not recommend spraying.<br /><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/rust-diseases-trees\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/rust-diseases-trees</a></p><p>While fungicide use in early spring during the infection period might be effective, it can be challenging to achieve good control, especially if weather does not cooperate with conditions needed for application as timing needs to be fairly exacting. Repeat treatments will be needed, and getting adequate coverage of an established tree is difficult. While copper-based sprays are broad-spectrum enough to suffice, other options (see final link)\u00a0would be better for the tree and perhaps the environment (so copper levels don't build up in the soil).</p><p>Is this a fruiting/crop-producing pear, or an ornamental flowering pear? The latter, like 'Bradford' and similar varieties, are highly invasive in our area and are best removed and replaced with different trees.<br /><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/bradford-pear\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/bradford-pear</a></p><p>If this is a pear you harvest fruit from, this up-to-date publication by Virginia Tech gives good detail about protecting fruit trees from common pests and diseases:<br /><a href=\"https://extension.umd.edu/resource/home-fruit-disease-and-pest-prevention-spray-schedule\">https://extension.umd.edu/resource/home-fruit-disease-and-pest-prevention-spray-schedule</a>\u00a0 Preventative sprays - whether organic or otherwise - are\u00a0key to maintaining fruit tree health and harvest quality and reliability.\u00a0This is\u00a0a long document because it covers so many topics, but it's searchable by \"pear,\" \"rust,\" or other applicable keywords.</p><p>Miri</p>",

                "answer": "The image shows two plants that appear to be Pepperonias (Baby Rubber Plants). There are no visible signs of pests or diseases in the leaves or soil. However, some minor issues can be observed:\n\n1. **Leaf Discoloration**: Some leaves show signs of yellowing or browning at the edges. This could be due to several factors such as overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiency, or low light exposure.\n\n2. **Potting Medium**: The soil appears compacted and there might be a lack of aeration, which can lead to root rot if the plant is overwatered. It's important to ensure that the potting medium is well-draining and loose to allow excess water to drain properly.\n\n**Recommended Management Strategy:**\n\n1. **Watering**: Check the watering schedule. Pepperonias prefer consistently moist but not soggy soil. Use your finger to check the moisture level about an inch below the surface. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Avoid letting the plant sit in standing water.\n\n2. **Lighting**: Ensure the plants receive adequate light. They thrive in bright, indirect light. If they are receiving too much direct sunlight, it could cause leaf burn. If the light is insufficient, the leaves may turn yellow or develop other signs of stress.\n\n3. **Nutrition**: Check if the soil is lacking nutrients. Pepperonias benefit from a balanced, slow-release fertilizer every few months during their growing season (spring and summer).\n\n4. **Soil Aeration**: Consider repotting the plants if the soil seems overly compacted. Use a well-draining potting mix and ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes.\n\n5. **Monitoring for Future Signs**: Keep an eye out for any new signs of pest infestations or diseases. While the Question Asker hasn't seen any, it\u2019s always good to be vigilant.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you should be able to help the Pepperonias thrive without needing to worry about pests.",

It started with a single insect, but as the week went on we have found approximately eleven. Last night eight of the eleven were found on our family room window. We have a Madagascar Dragon Tree we keep on the porch during the summer and bring in every year and the insects may be coming from within the planter, but we do not see them in the soil or on the tree. Additionally, we have had this tree for years and this is a new event. I have searched the internet and not been able to find a reference to them. What are they? Are they hazardous to our house? and, how do we get ride of them? I have attached images in the hopes you can identify them. Thank you,\u00a0",

The damage in photo #5023 looks like the trunk was girdled by staking straps. In general, straps should only be left on for six months and no longer than a year.<br /> <br /> As the trunk grows and widens, the staking straps can cause constriction around the trunk (a bit like a tight necktie or a boa constrictor).\u00a0<br /> <br /> What this does is that it can cause disruption of water and nutrients from the roots to the top of the tree and you may see dieback.\u00a0<br /> <br /> At this point, you can't fix the damage, but you can focus on keeping the tree healthy with regular water and avoiding additional injury. I\u00a0would also suggest removing the rocks at the base of the tree and replacing them with organic mulch. (Or just remove the ring and rocks.)",

Winter injury can be caused by a lot of things but usually not the warm period but what happens after the warm period. <br>Here is a link to the Michigan State University articles that where written following those cold events. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://msue.anr.msu.edu/resources/winter_injury_in_plants\">http://msue.anr.msu.edu/resources/winter_injury_in_plants</a><br>I would think the main problem was absolute cold and that the Southwest injury was only a contributing factor. The vigorous growth from the base of the tree indicates to me that the trunk itself was damage at and above the snowline and you got vigorous growth from the undamaged portion below the injury.   <br>Yes the white paint might have worked to reduce Southwest injury.<br>Unfortunately the fact that you now have mushrooms growing out of the tree indicates that wood rotting fungi are already in the tree attacking digesting the dead wood. There is no treatment to eradicate the fungi inside the tree. The tree will rot from the inside out. Your best bet is to remove the affected portion of the tree and focus on retraining the new sprouts from the base of the tree.<br><br><br>",

I still would like the trees to recover, but if that's not going to happen then perhaps I need to be told exactly to cut them down. I don't think there's an unaffected portion. Unfortunately, I forgot about the previous reply and trimmed some sprouts that were growing near to base. However, the new sprouts were growing from the damaged areas as well. I suppose I pruned them because the larger branches looked like they were doing well. The trees have grown taller, although without a central leader.

The way we can tell what the causative agent is - were these transplants or grown from seed?

                "answer": "The image shows a squash plant with leaf damage that appears to be caused by a chemical burn. This type of damage can occur when plants come into contact with herbicides, particularly those containing glyphosate (Roundup) or other broad-spectrum herbicides like 2,4-D and Grazon. These chemicals are typically applied to control weeds and can be toxic to some plant species if they are applied to the foliage.\n\nGiven the context provided, the recommended management strategy would involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Source of the Chemical**: Confirm whether the chemical in question is still present in the soil or whether it has degraded over time. Since no animals have been in the lot for two years, it's possible that the herbicide has dissipated somewhat, but it's important to test the soil to ensure it is safe for planting.\n\n2. **Soil Testing**: Conduct a soil test to determine the residual levels of the herbicides and to check for any other contaminants that might affect plant growth.\n\n3. **Plant Removal and Disposal**: If the soil tests indicate that the herbicides are still present at harmful levels, it may be necessary to remove the affected plants and dispose of them properly to prevent contamination of the soil.\n\n4. **Soil Amelioration**: If the herbicides are not present at harmful levels, you can proceed with amelioration techniques such as adding organic matter (compost or manure) to improve soil health and structure. This can help the soil retain moisture and nutrients, which are crucial for plant growth.\n\n5. **New Planting**: Once the soil is deemed safe and the soil has been amended if necessary, you can replant the squash or another suitable crop. Choose a variety that is resistant to herbicide damage, if available.\n\n6. **Preventative Measures**: In the future, consider using alternative methods of weed control that do not involve chemical herbicides, such as mulching, hand weeding, or using selective herbicides that target specific types of weeds without harming the desired crop.\n\nBy following these steps, you can address the issue and ensure that your new squash plants have a healthy growing environment.",

                "answer": "The image shows an ash tree that appears to have suffered significant damage, likely due to the freezes mentioned in the background information. The tree's branches are bare, with no leaves present, which is unusual for this time of year. Given the history of freezes in the area, it seems the tree may have suffered from winter kill, where cold temperatures caused the tree to lose its foliage and potentially the smaller branches.\n\n### Recommended Management Strategy:\n\n1. **Assessment of Damage**:\n   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the tree to determine the extent of the damage. Focus on identifying dead wood and any signs of disease or pests.\n\n2. **Pruning**:\n   - Remove any dead or severely damaged branches. This helps prevent the spread of disease and improves the tree\u2019s ability to heal.\n   - Prune back to healthy wood, making sure to cut above a lateral branch or the trunk at a 45-degree angle.\n\n3. **Fertilization**:\n   - Apply a balanced fertilizer to support the tree\u2019s recovery. Look for slow-release formulas that provide nutrients throughout the growing season.\n\n4. **Watering**:\n   - Ensure the tree receives adequate water, especially if there is a risk of drought. Water deeply, but avoid overwatering as this can lead to root rot.\n\n5. **Mulching**:\n   - Add a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Be sure not to pile the mulch too close to the trunk, as this can cause the bark to rot.\n\n6. **Monitoring**:\n   - Keep an eye on the tree for signs of recovery or further stress. Monitor for new growth in the upcoming months, which would indicate successful regrowth.\n\n7. **Disease and Pest Management**:\n   - Check for signs of disease or pests. If necessary, consult a professional arborist for treatment options. Common diseases affecting ash trees include ash dieback and ash borer.\n\n8. **Cold Protection (Future)**:\n   - For future winters, consider installing a windbreak or using protective barriers to shield the tree from extreme cold, although this might be impractical for established trees.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help the tree recover and potentially thrive despite the damage sustained. It\u2019s also advisable to consult with a local certified arborist who can provide more specific advice based on the local climate and conditions.",

This is due to quick temperature fluctuations, usually in late winter.\u00a0 White trunk guards are frequently used to help prevent the problem by reflecting the light and heating that leads to the cracking.\u00a0 Cleaning up the wound, and bark tracing can help the tree heal properly.\u00a0 Fertilizing the tree to stimulate growth can help.\u00a0 Fertilizing past mid-summer should be prevented since late season growth can lead to more cracking.\u00a0 Check out the following links for additional information and detail:</p> <p><a href=\"https://homegarden.cahnr.uconn.edu/factsheets/frost-cracks-and-sunscald-on-trees/\">Frost Cracks and Sunscald on Trees | Home and Garden Education Center (uconn.edu)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.purduelandscapereport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preparations-to-Prevent-Southwest-Injury.pdf\">Preparations to Prevent Southwest Injury (purduelandscapereport.org)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/barksplitting.pdf\">barksplitting.pdf (cornell.edu)</a></p> <p>I hope this is helpful.</p>",
